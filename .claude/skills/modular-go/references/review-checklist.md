# Modular Go Review Checklist

Use this checklist for a fast architecture sanity check before merge.

## API and Boundaries

- Is package responsibility explainable in one sentence?
- Is there one obvious primary entry point?
- Are exported symbols limited to stable contracts?
- If a wide interface exists, is it defined at the package entry and are all methods documented?
- Are helper packages domain-explicit (for example, `sliceutil`) and stateless?

## State and Lifecycle

- Can core logic be stateless functions instead of mutable objects?
- If a manager exists (for example, `SessionManager`), are operations exposed by ID?
- Are shared mutable registries synchronized with explicit, narrow lock scope?
- Is every shared resource acquisition paired with a deterministic release path?
- Is shutdown driven by `context.Context` instead of public `Close()` where possible?

## Parameters and Construction

- For simple optional parameters, are option functions sufficient and stable for call sites?
- For complex or coupled parameter sets, is a dedicated `Builder` provided?

## Orchestration and Shutdown

- Is orchestration thin, with helper methods focused on one capability each?
- Does each orchestration stage include a short intent comment?
- Are dependencies, background loops, and shutdown callbacks wired in one constructor path?
- Is every package boundary justified by a distinct responsibility, not file size?

## Transport Handlers (gRPC/HTTP)

- Do handlers follow unmarshal → delegate → marshal and nothing else?
- Is business logic delegated to injected domain dependencies, not implemented in handlers?
- Is error-to-status conversion centralized rather than scattered across handlers?
- Are domain dependencies injected via constructor, not accessed through globals?
