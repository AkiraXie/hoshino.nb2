Derived from the **[flake8-executable](../#flake8-executable-exe)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for executable `.py` files that do not have a shebang.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a
script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the
script.

If a `.py` file is executable, but does not have a shebang, it may be run
with the wrong interpreter, or fail to run at all.

If the file is meant to be executable, add a shebang, as in:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

Otherwise, remove the executable bit from the file
(e.g., `chmod -x __main__.py` or `git update-index --chmod=-x __main__.py`).

A file is considered executable if it has the executable bit set (i.e., its
permissions mode intersects with `0o111`). As such, *this rule is only
available on Unix-like systems*, and is not enforced on Windows or WSL.
