Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `nonlocal` names without bindings.

## Why is this bad?

`nonlocal` names must be bound to a name in an outer scope.
Violating this rule leads to a `SyntaxError` at runtime.

## Example

```python
def foo():
    def get_bar(self):
        nonlocal bar
        ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo():
    bar = 1

    def get_bar(self):
        nonlocal bar
        ...
```
