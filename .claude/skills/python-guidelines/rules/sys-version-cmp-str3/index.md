## What it does

Checks for comparisons that test `sys.version` against string literals,
such that the comparison will evaluate to `False` on Python 3.10 or later.

## Why is this bad?

Comparing `sys.version` to a string is error-prone and may cause subtle
bugs, as the comparison will be performed lexicographically, not
semantically. For example, `sys.version > "3.9"` will evaluate to `False`
when using Python 3.10, as `"3.10"` is lexicographically "less" than
`"3.9"`.

Instead, use `sys.version_info` to access the current major and minor
version numbers as a tuple, which can be compared to other tuples
without issue.

## Example

```python
import sys

sys.version > "3.9"  # `False` on Python 3.10.
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

sys.version_info > (3, 9)  # `True` on Python 3.10.
```
