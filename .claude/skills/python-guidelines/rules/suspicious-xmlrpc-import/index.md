Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for imports of the `xmlrpc` module.

## Why is this bad?

XMLRPC is a particularly dangerous XML module, as it is also concerned with
communicating data over a network. Use the `defused.xmlrpc.monkey_patch()`
function to monkey-patch the `xmlrpclib` module and mitigate remote XML
attacks.

## Example

```python
import xmlrpc
```
