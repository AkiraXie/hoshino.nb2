Derived from the **[tryceratops](../#tryceratops-try)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `logging.error` instead of `logging.exception` when
logging an exception.

## Why is this bad?

`logging.exception` logs the exception and the traceback, while
`logging.error` only logs the exception. The former is more appropriate
when logging an exception, as the traceback is often useful for debugging.

## Example

```python
import logging

def func():
    try:
        raise NotImplementedError
    except NotImplementedError:
        logging.error("Exception occurred")
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

def func():
    try:
        raise NotImplementedError
    except NotImplementedError:
        logging.exception("Exception occurred")
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe when run against `logging.error` calls,
but unsafe when marked against other logger-like calls (e.g.,
`logger.error`), since the rule is prone to false positives when detecting
logger-like calls outside of the `logging` module.

## Options

- [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects)
