## What it does

Checks for non-raw literal string arguments passed to the `match` parameter
of `pytest.raises()` where the string contains at least one unescaped
regex metacharacter.

## Why is this bad?

The `match` argument is implicitly converted to a regex under the hood.
It should be made explicit whether the string is meant to be a regex or a "plain" pattern
by prefixing the string with the `r` suffix, escaping the metacharacter(s)
in the string using backslashes, or wrapping the entire string in a call to
`re.escape()`.

## Example

```python
import pytest

with pytest.raises(Exception, match="A full sentence."):
    do_thing_that_raises()
```

If the pattern is intended to be a regular expression, use a raw string to signal this
intention:

```python
import pytest

with pytest.raises(Exception, match=r"A full sentence."):
    do_thing_that_raises()
```

Alternatively, escape any regex metacharacters with `re.escape`:

```python
import pytest
import re

with pytest.raises(Exception, match=re.escape("A full sentence.")):
    do_thing_that_raises()
```

or directly with backslashes:

```python
import pytest
import re

with pytest.raises(Exception, "A full sentence\\."):
    do_thing_that_raises()
```
