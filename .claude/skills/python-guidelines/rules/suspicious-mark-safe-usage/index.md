## What it does

Checks for uses of calls to `django.utils.safestring.mark_safe`.

## Why is this bad?

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute
arbitrary JavaScript. To guard against XSS attacks, Django templates
assumes that data is unsafe and automatically escapes malicious strings
before rending them.

`django.utils.safestring.mark_safe` marks a string as safe for use in HTML
templates, bypassing XSS protection. Its usage can be dangerous if the
contents of the string are dynamically generated, because it may allow
cross-site scripting attacks if the string is not properly escaped.

For dynamically generated strings, consider utilizing
`django.utils.html.format_html`.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to `django.utils.safestring.mark_safe`.

## Example

```python
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe

def render_username(username):
    return mark_safe(f"<i>{username}</i>")  # Dangerous if username is user-provided.
```

Use instead:

```python
from django.utils.html import format_html

def render_username(username):
    return format_html("<i>{}</i>", username)  # username is escaped.
```
