Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for multiline statements on one line.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations), including multi-clause statements on the same line is
discouraged.

## Example

```python
do_one(); do_two(); do_three()
```

Use instead:

```python
do_one()
do_two()
do_three()
```
