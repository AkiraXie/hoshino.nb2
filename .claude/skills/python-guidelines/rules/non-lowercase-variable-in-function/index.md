Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of non-lowercase variable names in functions.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) recommends that all function variables use lowercase names:

> Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to
> improve readability. Variable names follow the same convention as function names. mixedCase
> is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py),
> to retain backwards compatibility.

## Example

```python
def my_function(a):
    B = a + 3
    return B
```

Use instead:

```python
def my_function(a):
    b = a + 3
    return b
```
