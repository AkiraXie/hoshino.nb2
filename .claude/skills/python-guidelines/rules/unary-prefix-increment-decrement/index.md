Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the attempted use of the unary prefix increment (`++`) or
decrement operator (`--`).

## Why is this bad?

Python does not support the unary prefix increment or decrement operator.
Writing `++n` is equivalent to `+(+(n))` and writing `--n` is equivalent to
`-(-(n))`. In both cases, it is equivalent to `n`.

## Example

```python
++x
--y
```

Use instead:

```python
x += 1
y -= 1
```
