## What it does

Checks for `assert` statements that use non-empty tuples as test
conditions.

## Why is this bad?

Non-empty tuples are always `True`, so an `assert` statement with a
non-empty tuple as its test condition will always pass. This is likely a
mistake.

## Example

```python
assert (some_condition,)
```

Use instead:

```python
assert some_condition
```
