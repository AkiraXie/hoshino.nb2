Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of cryptographic keys with vulnerable key sizes.

## Why is this bad?

Small keys are easily breakable. For DSA and RSA, keys should be at least
2048 bits long. For EC, keys should be at least 224 bits long.

## Example

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import dsa, ec

dsa.generate_private_key(key_size=512)
ec.generate_private_key(curve=ec.SECT163K1())
```

Use instead:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import dsa, ec

dsa.generate_private_key(key_size=4096)
ec.generate_private_key(curve=ec.SECP384R1())
```
