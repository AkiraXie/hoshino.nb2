Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for import statements that import the current module.

## Why is this bad?

Importing a module from itself is a circular dependency and results
in an `ImportError` exception.

## Example

```python
# file: this_file.py
from this_file import foo

def foo(): ...
```
