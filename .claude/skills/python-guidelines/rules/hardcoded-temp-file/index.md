Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of hardcoded temporary file or directory paths.

## Why is this bad?

The use of hardcoded paths for temporary files can be insecure. If an
attacker discovers the location of a hardcoded path, they can replace the
contents of the file or directory with a malicious payload.

Other programs may also read or write contents to these hardcoded paths,
causing unexpected behavior.

## Example

```python
with open("/tmp/foo.txt", "w") as file:
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import tempfile

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as file:
    ...
```
