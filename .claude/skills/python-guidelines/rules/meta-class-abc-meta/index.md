Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `metaclass=abc.ABCMeta` to define abstract base classes
(ABCs).

## Why is this bad?

Instead of `class C(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta): ...`, use `class C(ABC): ...`
to define an abstract base class. Inheriting from the `ABC` wrapper class
is semantically identical to setting `metaclass=abc.ABCMeta`, but more
succinct.

## Example

```python
import abc

class C(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
import abc

class C(abc.ABC):
    pass
```

## Fix safety

The rule's fix is unsafe if the class has base classes. This is because the base classes might
be validating the class's other base classes (e.g., `typing.Protocol` does this) or otherwise
alter runtime behavior if more base classes are added.
The rule's fix will also be marked as unsafe if the class has
comments in its argument list that could be deleted.
