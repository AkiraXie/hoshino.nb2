Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Check for shallow `os.environ` copies.

## Why is this bad?

`os.environ` is not a `dict` object, but rather, a proxy object. As such, mutating a shallow
copy of `os.environ` will also mutate the original object.

See [BPO 15373](https://bugs.python.org/issue15373) for more information.

## Example

```python
import copy
import os

env = copy.copy(os.environ)
```

Use instead:

```python
import os

env = os.environ.copy()
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because replacing a shallow copy with a deep copy can lead
to unintended side effects. If the program modifies the shallow copy at some point, changing it
to a deep copy may prevent those modifications from affecting the original data, potentially
altering the program's behavior.
