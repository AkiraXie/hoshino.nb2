Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `assert` keyword.

## Why is this bad?

Assertions are removed when Python is run with optimization requested
(i.e., when the `-O` flag is present), which is a common practice in
production environments. As such, assertions should not be used for runtime
validation of user input or to enforce interface constraints.

Consider raising a meaningful error instead of using `assert`.

## Example

```python
assert x > 0, "Expected positive value."
```

Use instead:

```python
if not x > 0:
    raise ValueError("Expected positive value.")

# or even better:
if x <= 0:
    raise ValueError("Expected positive value.")
```
