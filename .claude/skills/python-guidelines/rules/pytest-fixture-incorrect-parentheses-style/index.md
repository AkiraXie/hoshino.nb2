Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for argument-free `@pytest.fixture()` decorators with or without
parentheses, depending on the [`lint.flake8-pytest-style.fixture-parentheses`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-pytest-style_fixture-parentheses)
setting.

## Why is this bad?

If a `@pytest.fixture()` doesn't take any arguments, the parentheses are
optional.

Either removing those unnecessary parentheses *or* requiring them for all
fixtures is fine, but it's best to be consistent. The rule defaults to
removing unnecessary parentheses, to match the documentation of the
official pytest projects.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def my_fixture(): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def my_fixture(): ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there's comments in the
`pytest.fixture` decorator.

For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(
    # comment
    # scope = "module"
)
def my_fixture(): ...
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-pytest-style.fixture-parentheses`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-pytest-style_fixture-parentheses)
