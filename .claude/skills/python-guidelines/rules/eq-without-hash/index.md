## What it does

Checks for classes that implement `__eq__` but not `__hash__`.

## Why is this bad?

A class that implements `__eq__` but not `__hash__` will have its hash
method implicitly set to `None`, regardless of if a superclass defines
`__hash__`. This will cause the class to be unhashable, which will in turn
cause issues when using instances of the class as keys in a dictionary or
members of a set.

## Example

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "monty"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return isinstance(other, Person) and other.name == self.name
```

Use instead:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "monty"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return isinstance(other, Person) and other.name == self.name

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.name)
```

In general, it is unsound to inherit a `__hash__` implementation from a parent class while
overriding the `__eq__` implementation because the two must be kept in sync. However, an easy
way to resolve this error in cases where it *is* sound is to explicitly set `__hash__` to the
parent class's implementation:

```python
class Developer(Person):
    def __init__(self): ...

    def __eq__(self, other): ...

    __hash__ = Person.__hash__
```
