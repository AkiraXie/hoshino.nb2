Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for three or more consecutive if-statements with direct returns

## Why is this bad?

These can be simplified by using a dictionary

## Example

```python
def find_phrase(x):
    if x == 1:
        return "Hello"
    elif x == 2:
        return "Goodbye"
    elif x == 3:
        return "Good morning"
    else:
        return "Goodnight"
```

Use instead:

```python
def find_phrase(x):
    phrases = {1: "Hello", 2: "Goodye", 3: "Good morning"}
    return phrases.get(x, "Goodnight")
```
