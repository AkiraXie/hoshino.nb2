Derived from the **[flake8-debugger](../#flake8-debugger-t10)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of debugger calls and imports.

## Why is this bad?

Debugger calls and imports should be used for debugging purposes only. The
presence of a debugger call or import in production code is likely a
mistake and may cause unintended behavior, such as exposing sensitive
information or causing the program to hang.

Instead, consider using a logging library to log information about the
program's state, and writing tests to verify that the program behaves
as expected.

## Example

```python
def foo():
    breakpoint()
```
