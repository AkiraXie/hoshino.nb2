Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `subprocess.Popen` with a `preexec_fn` argument.

## Why is this bad?

The `preexec_fn` argument is unsafe within threads as it can lead to
deadlocks. Furthermore, `preexec_fn` is [targeted for deprecation](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82616).

Instead, consider using task-specific arguments such as `env`,
`start_new_session`, and `process_group`. These are not prone to deadlocks
and are more explicit.

## Example

```python
import os, subprocess

subprocess.Popen(foo, preexec_fn=os.setsid)
subprocess.Popen(bar, preexec_fn=os.setpgid(0, 0))
```

Use instead:

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.Popen(foo, start_new_session=True)
subprocess.Popen(bar, process_group=0)  # Introduced in Python 3.11
```
