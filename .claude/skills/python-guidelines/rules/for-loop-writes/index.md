Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for the use of `IOBase.write` in a for loop.

## Why is this bad?

When writing a batch of elements, it's more idiomatic to use a single method call to
`IOBase.writelines`, rather than write elements one by one.

## Example

```python
from pathlib import Path

with Path("file").open("w") as f:
    for line in lines:
        f.write(line)

with Path("file").open("wb") as f_b:
    for line_b in lines_b:
        f_b.write(line_b.encode())
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

with Path("file").open("w") as f:
    f.writelines(lines)

with Path("file").open("wb") as f_b:
    f_b.writelines(line_b.encode() for line_b in lines_b)
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked as unsafe if it would cause comments to be deleted.
