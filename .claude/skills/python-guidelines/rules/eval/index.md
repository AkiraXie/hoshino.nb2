Derived from the **[pygrep-hooks](../#pygrep-hooks-pgh)** linter.

**Warning: This rule has been removed and its documentation is only available for historical reasons.**

## Removed

This rule is identical to [S307](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/suspicious-eval-usage/) which should be used instead.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the builtin `eval()` function.

## Why is this bad?

The `eval()` function is insecure as it enables arbitrary code execution.

## Example

```python
def foo():
    x = eval(input("Enter a number: "))
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo():
    x = input("Enter a number: ")
    ...
```
