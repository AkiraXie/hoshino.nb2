Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.yield_fixture` usage.

## Why is this bad?

`pytest.yield_fixture` is deprecated. `pytest.fixture` should be used instead.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.yield_fixture()
def my_fixture():
    obj = SomeClass()
    yield obj
    obj.cleanup()
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def my_fixture():
    obj = SomeClass()
    yield obj
    obj.cleanup()
```
