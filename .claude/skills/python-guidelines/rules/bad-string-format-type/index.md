Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for mismatched argument types in "old-style" format strings.

## Why is this bad?

The format string is not checked at compile time, so it is easy to
introduce bugs by mistyping the format string.

## Example

```python
print("%d" % "1")
```

Use instead:

```python
print("%d" % 1)
```
