Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for uses of hardcoded charsets, which are defined in Python string module.

## Why is this bad?

Usage of named charsets from the standard library is more readable and less error-prone.

## Example

```python
x = "0123456789"
y in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

Use instead

```python
import string

x = string.digits
y in string.ascii_lowercase
```
