## What it does

Checks for comparisons that test `sys.version` against string literals,
such that the comparison would fail if the major version number were
ever incremented to Python 10 or higher.

## Why is this bad?

Comparing `sys.version` to a string is error-prone and may cause subtle
bugs, as the comparison will be performed lexicographically, not
semantically.

Instead, use `sys.version_info` to access the current major and minor
version numbers as a tuple, which can be compared to other tuples
without issue.

## Example

```python
import sys

sys.version >= "3"  # `False` on Python 10.
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

sys.version_info >= (3,)  # `True` on Python 10.
```
