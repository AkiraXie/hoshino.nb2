Derived from the **[Airflow](../#airflow-air)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of Airflow functions and values that have been moved to its providers
but still have a compatibility layer (e.g., `apache-airflow-providers-standard`).

## Why is this bad?

Airflow 3.0 moved various deprecated functions, members, and other
values to its providers. Even though these symbols still work fine on Airflow 3.0,
they are expected to be removed in a future version. The user is suggested to install
the corresponding provider and replace the original usage with the one in the provider.

## Example

```python
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator

def print_context(ds=None, **kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    print(ds)

print_the_context = PythonOperator(
    task_id="print_the_context", python_callable=print_context
)
```

Use instead:

```python
from airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator

def print_context(ds=None, **kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    print(ds)

print_the_context = PythonOperator(
    task_id="print_the_context", python_callable=print_context
)
```
