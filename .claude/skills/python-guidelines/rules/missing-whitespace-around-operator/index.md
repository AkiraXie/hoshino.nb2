Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for missing whitespace around all operators.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves), there should be one space before and after all
assignment (`=`), augmented assignment (`+=`, `-=`, etc.), comparison,
and Booleans operators.

## Example

```python
if number==42:
    print('you have found the meaning of life')
```

Use instead:

```python
if number == 42:
    print('you have found the meaning of life')
```
