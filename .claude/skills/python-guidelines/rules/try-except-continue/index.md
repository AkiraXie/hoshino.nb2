Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `try`-`except`-`continue` pattern.

## Why is this bad?

The `try`-`except`-`continue` pattern suppresses all exceptions.
Suppressing exceptions may hide errors that could otherwise reveal
unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.
Instead, consider logging the exception.

## Example

```python
import logging

while predicate:
    try:
        ...
    except Exception:
        continue
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

while predicate:
    try:
        ...
    except Exception as exc:
        logging.exception("Error occurred")
```
