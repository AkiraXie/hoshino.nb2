Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `global` keyword at the module level.

## Why is this bad?

The `global` keyword is used within functions to indicate that a name
refers to a global variable, rather than a local variable.

At the module level, all names are global by default, so the `global`
keyword is redundant.
