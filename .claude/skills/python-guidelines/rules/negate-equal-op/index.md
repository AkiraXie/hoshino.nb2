Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for negated `==` operators.

## Why is this bad?

Negated `==` operators are less readable than `!=` operators. When testing
for non-equality, it is more common to use `!=` than `==`.

## Example

```python
not a == b
```

Use instead:

```python
a != b
```

## Fix safety

The fix is marked as unsafe, as it might change the behaviour
if `a` and/or `b` overrides `__eq__`/`__ne__`
in such a manner that they don't return booleans.
