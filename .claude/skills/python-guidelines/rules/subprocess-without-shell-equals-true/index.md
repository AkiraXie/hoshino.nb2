Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Check for method calls that initiate a subprocess without a shell.

## Why is this bad?

Starting a subprocess without a shell can prevent attackers from executing
arbitrary shell commands; however, it is still error-prone. Consider
validating the input.

## Known problems

Prone to false positives as it is difficult to determine whether the
passed arguments have been validated ([#4045](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4045)).

## Example

```python
import subprocess

cmd = input("Enter a command: ").split()
subprocess.run(cmd)
```
