Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `TypeVar`, `TypeVarTuple`, `ParamSpec`, and `NewType`
definitions in which the name of the type parameter does not match the name
of the variable to which it is assigned.

## Why is this bad?

When defining a `TypeVar` or a related type parameter, Python allows you to
provide a name for the type parameter. According to [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#generics), the name
provided to the `TypeVar` constructor must be equal to the name of the
variable to which it is assigned.

## Example

```python
from typing import TypeVar

T = TypeVar("U")
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")
```
