Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for function docstrings that include the function's signature in
the summary line.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) recommends against including a function's signature in its
docstring. Instead, consider using type annotations as a form of
documentation for the function's parameters and return value.

This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of
convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the `google` and
`pep257` conventions, and disabled when using the `numpy` convention.

## Example

```python
def foo(a, b):
    """foo(a: int, b: int) -> list[int]"""
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(a: int, b: int) -> list[int]:
    """Return a list of a and b."""
```
