## What it does

Checks for bidirectional formatting characters.

## Why is this bad?

The interaction between bidirectional formatting characters and the
surrounding code can be surprising to those that are unfamiliar
with right-to-left writing systems.

In some cases, bidirectional formatting characters can also be used to
obfuscate code and introduce or mask security vulnerabilities.

## Example

```python
example = "x‏" * 100  #    "‏x" is assigned
```

The example uses two `RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK`s to make the `100 *` appear inside the comment.
Without the `RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK`s, the code looks like this:

```python
example = "x" * 100  #    "x" is assigned
```
