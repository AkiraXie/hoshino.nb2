Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for extraneous tabs after a comma.

## Why is this bad?

Commas should be followed by one space, never tabs.

## Example

```python
a = 4,\t5
```

Use instead:

```python
a = 4, 5
```
