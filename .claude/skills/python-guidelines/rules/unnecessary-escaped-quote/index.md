Derived from the **[flake8-quotes](../#flake8-quotes-q)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for strings that include unnecessarily escaped quotes.

## Why is this bad?

If a string contains an escaped quote that doesn't match the quote
character used for the string, it's unnecessary and can be removed.

## Example

```python
foo = "bar\'s"
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = "bar's"
```

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter). The
formatter automatically removes unnecessary escapes, making the rule
redundant.
