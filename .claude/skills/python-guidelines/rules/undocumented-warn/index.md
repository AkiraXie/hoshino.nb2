Derived from the **[flake8-logging](../#flake8-logging-log)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `logging.WARN`.

## Why is this bad?

The `logging.WARN` constant is an undocumented alias for `logging.WARNING`.

Although it’s not explicitly deprecated, `logging.WARN` is not mentioned
in the `logging` documentation. Prefer `logging.WARNING` instead.

## Example

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN)
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)
```
