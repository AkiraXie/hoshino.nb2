This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for functions declared `async` that do not await or otherwise use features requiring the
function to be declared `async`.

## Why is this bad?

Declaring a function `async` when it's not is usually a mistake, and will artificially limit the
contexts where that function may be called. In some cases, labeling a function `async` is
semantically meaningful (e.g. with the trio library).

## Example

```python
async def foo():
    bar()
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo():
    bar()
```
