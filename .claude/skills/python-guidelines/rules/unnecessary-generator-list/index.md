Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary generators that can be rewritten as list
comprehensions (or with `list()` directly).

## Why is this bad?

It is unnecessary to use `list()` around a generator expression, since
there are equivalent comprehensions for these types. Using a
comprehension is clearer and more idiomatic.

Further, if the comprehension can be removed entirely, as in the case of
`list(x for x in foo)`, it's better to use `list(foo)` directly, since it's
even more direct.

## Example

```python
list(f(x) for x in foo)
list(x for x in foo)
list((x for x in foo))
```

Use instead:

```python
[f(x) for x in foo]
list(foo)
list(foo)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
