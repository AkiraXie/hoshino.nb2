Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `from_float` and `from_decimal` usages to construct
`Decimal` and `Fraction` instances.

## Why is this bad?

Since Python 3.2, the `Fraction` and `Decimal` classes can be constructed
by passing float or decimal instances to the constructor directly. As such,
the use of `from_float` and `from_decimal` methods is unnecessary, and
should be avoided in favor of the more concise constructor syntax.

However, there are important behavioral differences between the `from_*` methods
and the constructors:

- The `from_*` methods validate their argument types and raise `TypeError` for invalid types
- The constructors accept broader argument types without validation
- The `from_*` methods have different parameter names than the constructors

## Example

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from fractions import Fraction

Decimal.from_float(4.2)
Decimal.from_float(float("inf"))
Fraction.from_float(4.2)
Fraction.from_decimal(Decimal("4.2"))
```

Use instead:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from fractions import Fraction

Decimal(4.2)
Decimal("inf")
Fraction(4.2)
Fraction(Decimal("4.2"))
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe by default because:

- The `from_*` methods provide type validation that the constructors don't
- Removing type validation can change program behavior
- The parameter names are different between methods and constructors
- The fix may remove comments attached to the original expression

The fix is marked as safe only when:

- The argument type is known to be valid for the target constructor
- No keyword arguments are used, or they match the constructor's parameters
