## What it does

Checks for uses of mapping-type values in `printf`-style format strings
without named placeholders.

## Why is this bad?

When using mapping-type values (such as `dict`) in `printf`-style format
strings, the keys must be named. Otherwise, the expression will raise a
`TypeError`.

## Example

```python
"%s, %s" % {"greeting": "Hello", "name": "World"}
```

Use instead:

```python
"%(greeting)s, %(name)s" % {"greeting": "Hello", "name": "World"}
```

Or:

```python
"%s, %s" % ("Hello", "World")
```
