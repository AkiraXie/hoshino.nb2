Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for docstring sections that are not separated by a blank line.

## Why is this bad?

This rule enforces consistency in numpy-style and Google-style docstrings,
and helps ensure compatibility with documentation tooling.

Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by
a blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header
and a section body. Sections should be separated by a single blank line.

This rule is enabled when using the `numpy` and `google` conventions, and
disabled when using the `pep257` convention.

## Example

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance : float
        Distance traveled.
    time : float
        Time spent traveling.
    Returns
    -------
    float
        Speed as distance divided by time.
    Raises
    ------
    FasterThanLightError
        If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```

Use instead:

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance : float
        Distance traveled.
    time : float
        Time spent traveling.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises
    ------
    FasterThanLightError
        If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```
