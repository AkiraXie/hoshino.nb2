Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for classes that have [PEP 695](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#type-params)
while also inheriting from `typing.Generic` or `typing_extensions.Generic`.

## Why is this bad?

Such classes cause errors at runtime:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar

U = TypeVar("U")

# TypeError: Cannot inherit from Generic[...] multiple times.
class C[T](Generic[U]): ...
```

## Example

```python
from typing import Generic, ParamSpec, TypeVar, TypeVarTuple

U = TypeVar("U")
P = ParamSpec("P")
Ts = TypeVarTuple("Ts")

class C[T](Generic[U, P, *Ts]): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class C[T, U, **P, *Ts]: ...
```

## Fix safety

As the fix changes runtime behaviour, it is always marked as unsafe.
Additionally, comments within the fix range will not be preserved.
