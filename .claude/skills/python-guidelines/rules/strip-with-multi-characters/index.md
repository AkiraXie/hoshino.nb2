Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of multi-character strings in `.strip()`, `.lstrip()`, and
`.rstrip()` calls.

## Why is this bad?

All characters in the call to `.strip()`, `.lstrip()`, or `.rstrip()` are
removed from the leading and trailing ends of the string. If the string
contains multiple characters, the reader may be misled into thinking that
a prefix or suffix is being removed, rather than a set of characters.

In Python 3.9 and later, you can use `str.removeprefix` and
`str.removesuffix` to remove an exact prefix or suffix from a string,
respectively, which should be preferred when possible.

## Known problems

As a heuristic, this rule only flags multi-character strings that contain
duplicate characters. This allows usages like `.strip("xyz")`, which
removes all occurrences of the characters `x`, `y`, and `z` from the
leading and trailing ends of the string, but not `.strip("foo")`.

The use of unique, multi-character strings may be intentional and
consistent with the intent of `.strip()`, `.lstrip()`, or `.rstrip()`,
while the use of duplicate-character strings is very likely to be a
mistake.

## Example

```python
"text.txt".strip(".txt")  # "e"
```

Use instead:

```python
"text.txt".removesuffix(".txt")  # "text"
```
