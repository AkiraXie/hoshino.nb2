Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `itertools.batched` calls without an explicit `strict` parameter.

## Why is this bad?

By default, if the length of the iterable is not divisible by
the second argument to `itertools.batched`, the last batch
will be shorter than the rest.

In Python 3.13, a `strict` parameter was added which allows controlling if the batches must be of uniform length.
Pass `strict=True` to raise a `ValueError` if the batches are of non-uniform length.
Otherwise, pass `strict=False` to make the intention explicit.

## Example

```python
import itertools

itertools.batched(iterable, n)
```

Use instead if the batches must be of uniform length:

```python
import itertools

itertools.batched(iterable, n, strict=True)
```

Or if the batches can be of non-uniform length:

```python
import itertools

itertools.batched(iterable, n, strict=False)
```

## Known deviations

Unlike the upstream `B911`, this rule will not report infinite iterators
(e.g., `itertools.cycle(...)`).
