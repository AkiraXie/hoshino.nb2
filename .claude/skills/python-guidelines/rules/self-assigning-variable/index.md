Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for self-assignment of variables.

## Why is this bad?

Self-assignment of variables is redundant and likely a mistake.

## Example

```python
country = "Poland"
country = country
```

Use instead:

```python
country = "Poland"
```
