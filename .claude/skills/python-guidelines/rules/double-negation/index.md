Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for double negations (i.e., multiple `not` operators).

## Why is this bad?

A double negation is redundant and less readable than omitting the `not`
operators entirely.

## Example

```python
not (not a)
```

Use instead:

```python
a
```
