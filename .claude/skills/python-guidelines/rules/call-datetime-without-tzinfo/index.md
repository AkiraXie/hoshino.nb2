## What it does

Checks for `datetime` instantiations that do not specify a timezone.

## Why is this bad?

`datetime` objects are "naive" by default, in that they do not include
timezone information. "Naive" objects are easy to understand, but ignore
some aspects of reality, which can lead to subtle bugs. Timezone-aware
`datetime` objects are preferred, as they represent a specific moment in
time, unlike "naive" objects.

By providing a non-`None` value for `tzinfo`, a `datetime` can be made
timezone-aware.

## Example

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
```

Use instead:

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
```

Or, on Python 3.11 and later:

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.UTC)
```
