## What it does

Checks for functions that start a process without a shell.

## Why is this bad?

Invoking any kind of external executable via a function call can pose
security risks if arbitrary variables are passed to the executable, or if
the input is otherwise unsanitised or unvalidated.

This rule specifically flags functions in the `os` module that spawn
subprocesses *without* the use of a shell. Note that these typically pose a
much smaller security risk than subprocesses that are started *with* a
shell, which are flagged by [`start-process-with-a-shell`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/start-process-with-a-shell) (`S605`).
This gives you the option of enabling one rule while disabling the other
if you decide that the security risk from these functions is acceptable
for your use case.

## Example

```python
import os

def insecure_function(arbitrary_user_input: str):
    os.spawnlp(os.P_NOWAIT, "/bin/mycmd", "mycmd", arbitrary_user_input)
```
