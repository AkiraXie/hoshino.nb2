## What it does

Checks for `__iter__` methods in stubs that return `Iterable[T]` instead
of an `Iterator[T]`.

## Why is this bad?

`__iter__` methods should always should return an `Iterator` of some kind,
not an `Iterable`.

In Python, an `Iterable` is an object that has an `__iter__` method; an
`Iterator` is an object that has `__iter__` and `__next__` methods. All
`__iter__` methods are expected to return `Iterator`s. Type checkers may
not always recognize an object as being iterable if its `__iter__` method
does not return an `Iterator`.

Every `Iterator` is an `Iterable`, but not every `Iterable` is an `Iterator`.
For example, `list` is an `Iterable`, but not an `Iterator`; you can obtain
an iterator over a list's elements by passing the list to `iter()`:

```python
>>> import collections.abc
>>> x = [42]
>>> isinstance(x, collections.abc.Iterable)
True
>>> isinstance(x, collections.abc.Iterator)
False
>>> next(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'list' object is not an iterator
>>> y = iter(x)
>>> isinstance(y, collections.abc.Iterable)
True
>>> isinstance(y, collections.abc.Iterator)
True
>>> next(y)
42
```

Using `Iterable` rather than `Iterator` as a return type for an `__iter__`
methods would imply that you would not necessarily be able to call `next()`
on the returned object, violating the expectations of the interface.

## Example

```python
import collections.abc

class Klass:
    def __iter__(self) -> collections.abc.Iterable[str]: ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import collections.abc

class Klass:
    def __iter__(self) -> collections.abc.Iterator[str]: ...
```
