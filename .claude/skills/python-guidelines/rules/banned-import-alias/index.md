Derived from the **[flake8-import-conventions](../#flake8-import-conventions-icn)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for imports that use non-standard naming conventions, like
`import tensorflow.keras.backend as K`.

## Why is this bad?

Consistency is good. Avoid using a non-standard naming convention for
imports, and, in particular, choosing import aliases that violate PEP 8.

For example, aliasing via `import tensorflow.keras.backend as K` violates
the guidance of PEP 8, and is thus avoided in some projects.

## Example

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
```

Use instead:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.keras.backend
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-import-conventions.banned-aliases`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-import-conventions_banned-aliases)
