## What it does

Checks for possible wildcard injections in calls to `subprocess.Popen()`.

## Why is this bad?

Wildcard injections can lead to unexpected behavior if unintended files are
matched by the wildcard. Consider using a more specific path instead.

## Example

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.Popen(["chmod", "777", "*.py"], shell=True)
```

Use instead:

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.Popen(["chmod", "777", "main.py"], shell=True)
```
