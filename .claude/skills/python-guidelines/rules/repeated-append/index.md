Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for consecutive calls to `append`.

## Why is this bad?

Consecutive calls to `append` can be less efficient than batching them into
a single `extend`. Each `append` resizes the list individually, whereas an
`extend` can resize the list once for all elements.

## Known problems

This rule is prone to false negatives due to type inference limitations,
as it will only detect lists that are instantiated as literals or annotated
with a type annotation.

## Example

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]

nums.append(4)
nums.append(5)
nums.append(6)
```

Use instead:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]

nums.extend((4, 5, 6))
```
