Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.fail` calls without a message.

## Why is this bad?

`pytest.fail` calls without a message make it harder to understand and debug test failures.

## Example

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    pytest.fail()

def test_bar():
    pytest.fail("")

def test_baz():
    pytest.fail(reason="")
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    pytest.fail("...")

def test_bar():
    pytest.fail(reason="...")
```
