Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `@pytest.mark.usefixtures()` decorators that aren't passed any
arguments.

## Why is this bad?

A `@pytest.mark.usefixtures()` decorator that isn't passed any arguments is
useless and should be removed.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.usefixtures()
def test_something(): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def test_something(): ...
```
