Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for multiple `isinstance` calls on the same target.

## Why is this bad?

To check if an object is an instance of any one of multiple types
or classes, it is unnecessary to use multiple `isinstance` calls, as
the second argument of the `isinstance` built-in function accepts a
tuple of types and classes.

Using a single `isinstance` call implements the same behavior with more
concise code and clearer intent.

## Example

```python
if isinstance(obj, int) or isinstance(obj, float):
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
if isinstance(obj, (int, float)):
    pass
```
