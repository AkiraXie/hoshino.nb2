Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of type comments (e.g., `x = 1 # type: int`) in stub
files.

## Why is this bad?

Stub (`.pyi`) files should use type annotations directly, rather
than type comments, even if they're intended to support Python 2, since
stub files are not executed at runtime. The one exception is `# type: ignore`.

## Example

```python
x = 1  # type: int
```

Use instead:

```python
x: int = 1
```
