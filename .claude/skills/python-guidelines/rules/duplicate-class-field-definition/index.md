Derived from the **[flake8-pie](../#flake8-pie-pie)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for duplicate field definitions in classes.

## Why is this bad?

Defining a field multiple times in a class body is redundant and likely a
mistake.

## Example

```python
class Person:
    name = Tom
    ...
    name = Ben
```

Use instead:

```python
class Person:
    name = Tom
    ...
```

## Fix safety

This fix is always marked as unsafe since we cannot know
for certain which assignment was intended.
