Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Check for multiple imports on one line.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports), "imports should usually be on separate lines."

## Example

```python
import sys, os
```

Use instead:

```python
import os
import sys
```
