Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `raise` statements that raise `NotImplemented`.

## Why is this bad?

`NotImplemented` is an exception used by binary special methods to indicate
that an operation is not implemented with respect to a particular type.

`NotImplemented` should not be raised directly. Instead, raise
`NotImplementedError`, which is used to indicate that the method is
abstract or not implemented in the derived class.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    def bar(self):
        raise NotImplemented
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    def bar(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
```
