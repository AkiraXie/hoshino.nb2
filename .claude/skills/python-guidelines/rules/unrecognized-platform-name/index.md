Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Check for unrecognized platform names in `sys.platform` checks.

**Note**: this rule is only enabled in `.pyi` stub files.

## Why is this bad?

If a `sys.platform` check compares to a platform name outside of a
small set of known platforms (e.g. "linux", "win32", etc.), it's likely
a typo or a platform name that is not recognized by type checkers.

The list of known platforms is: "linux", "win32", "cygwin", "darwin".

## Example

```python
import sys

if sys.platform == "linus": ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

if sys.platform == "linux": ...
```
