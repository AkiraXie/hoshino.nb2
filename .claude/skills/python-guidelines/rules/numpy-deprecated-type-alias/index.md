Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for deprecated NumPy type aliases.

## Why is this bad?

NumPy's `np.int` has long been an alias of the builtin `int`; the same
is true of `np.float` and others. These aliases exist primarily
for historic reasons, and have been a cause of frequent confusion
for newcomers.

These aliases were deprecated in 1.20, and removed in 1.24.
Note, however, that `np.bool` and `np.long` were reintroduced in 2.0 with
different semantics, and are thus omitted from this rule.

## Example

```python
import numpy as np

np.int
```

Use instead:

```python
int
```
