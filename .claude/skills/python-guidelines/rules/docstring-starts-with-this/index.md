Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for docstrings that start with `This`.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) recommends that the first line of a docstring be written in the
imperative mood, for consistency.

Hint: to rewrite the docstring in the imperative, phrase the first line as
if it were a command.

This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of
convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the `numpy`
convention, and disabled when using the `google` and `pep257` conventions.

## Example

```python
def average(values: list[float]) -> float:
    """This function returns the mean of the given values."""
```

Use instead:

```python
def average(values: list[float]) -> float:
    """Return the mean of the given values."""
```
