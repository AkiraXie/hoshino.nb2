Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `hasattr` to test if an object is callable (e.g.,
`hasattr(obj, "__call__")`).

## Why is this bad?

Using `hasattr` is an unreliable mechanism for testing if an object is
callable. If `obj` implements a custom `__getattr__`, or if its `__call__`
is itself not callable, you may get misleading results.

Instead, use `callable(obj)` to test if `obj` is callable.

## Example

```python
hasattr(obj, "__call__")
```

Use instead:

```python
callable(obj)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because the replacement may not be semantically
equivalent to the original expression, potentially changing the behavior of the code.

For example, an imported module may have a `__call__` attribute but is not considered
a callable object:

```python
import operator

assert hasattr(operator, "__call__")
assert callable(operator) is False
```

Additionally, `__call__` may be defined only as an instance method:

```python
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__call__ = None

assert hasattr(A(), "__call__")
assert callable(A()) is False
```

Additionally, if there are comments in the `hasattr` call expression, they may be removed:

```python
hasattr(
    # comment 1
    obj,  # comment 2
    # comment 3
    "__call__",  # comment 4
    # comment 5
)
```
