Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `import` statements outside of a module's top-level scope, such
as within a function or class definition.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports) recommends placing imports not only at the top-level of a module,
but at the very top of the file, "just after any module comments and
docstrings, and before module globals and constants."

`import` statements have effects that are global in scope; defining them at
the top level has a number of benefits. For example, it makes it easier to
identify the dependencies of a module, and ensures that any invalid imports
are caught regardless of whether a specific function is called or class is
instantiated.

An import statement would typically be placed within a function only to
avoid a circular dependency, to defer a costly module load, or to avoid
loading a dependency altogether in a certain runtime environment.

## Example

```python
def print_python_version():
    import platform

    print(platform.python_version())
```

Use instead:

```python
import platform

def print_python_version():
    print(platform.python_version())
```
