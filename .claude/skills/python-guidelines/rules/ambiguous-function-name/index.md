Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of the characters 'l', 'O', or 'I' as function names.

## Why is this bad?

In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the
numerals one and zero. When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead.

## Example

```python
def l(x): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def long_name(x): ...
```
