Derived from the **[flake8-return](../#flake8-return-ret)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `else` statements with a `return` statement in the preceding
`if` block.

## Why is this bad?

The `else` statement is not needed as the `return` statement will always
break out of the enclosing function. Removing the `else` will reduce
nesting and make the code more readable.

## Example

```python
def foo(bar, baz):
    if bar:
        return 1
    else:
        return baz
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(bar, baz):
    if bar:
        return 1
    return baz
```
