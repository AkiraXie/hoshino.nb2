Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `except` blocks that handle all exceptions, but are not the last
`except` block in a `try` statement.

## Why is this bad?

When an exception is raised within a `try` block, the `except` blocks are
evaluated in order, and the first matching block is executed. If an `except`
block handles all exceptions, but isn't the last block, Python will raise a
`SyntaxError`, as the following blocks would never be executed.

## Example

```python
def reciprocal(n):
    try:
        reciprocal = 1 / n
    except:
        print("An exception occurred.")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero.")
    else:
        return reciprocal
```

Use instead:

```python
def reciprocal(n):
    try:
        reciprocal = 1 / n
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero.")
    except:
        print("An exception occurred.")
    else:
        return reciprocal
```
