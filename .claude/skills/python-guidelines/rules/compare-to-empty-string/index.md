Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for comparisons to empty strings.

## Why is this bad?

An empty string is falsy, so it is unnecessary to compare it to `""`. If
the value can be something else Python considers falsy, such as `None`,
`0`, or another empty container, then the code is not equivalent.

## Known problems

High false positive rate, as the check is context-insensitive and does not
consider the type of the variable being compared ([#4282](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4282)).

## Example

```python
x: str = ...

if x == "":
    print("x is empty")
```

Use instead:

```python
x: str = ...

if not x:
    print("x is empty")
```
