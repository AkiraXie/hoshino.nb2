Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `__slots__` definitions that are not ordered according to a
[natural sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order).

## Why is this bad?

Consistency is good. Use a common convention for this special variable
to make your code more readable and idiomatic.

## Example

```python
class Dog:
    __slots__ = "name", "breed"
```

Use instead:

```python
class Dog:
    __slots__ = "breed", "name"
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe in three situations.

Firstly, the fix is unsafe if there are any comments that take up
a whole line by themselves inside the `__slots__` definition, for example:

```python
class Foo:
    __slots__ = [
        # eggy things
        "duck_eggs",
        "chicken_eggs",
        # hammy things
        "country_ham",
        "parma_ham",
    ]
```

This is a common pattern used to delimit categories within a class's slots,
but it would be out of the scope of this rule to attempt to maintain these
categories when applying a natural sort to the items of `__slots__`.

Secondly, the fix is also marked as unsafe if there are more than two
`__slots__` items on a single line and that line also has a trailing
comment, since here it is impossible to accurately gauge which item the
comment should be moved with when sorting `__slots__`:

```python
class Bar:
    __slots__ = [
        "a", "c", "e",  # a comment
        "b", "d", "f",  # a second  comment
    ]
```

Lastly, this rule's fix is marked as unsafe whenever Ruff can detect that
code elsewhere in the same file reads the `__slots__` variable in some way
and the `__slots__` variable is not assigned to a set. This is because the
order of the items in `__slots__` may have semantic significance if the
`__slots__` of a class is being iterated over, or being assigned to another
value.

In the vast majority of other cases, this rule's fix is unlikely to
cause breakage; as such, Ruff will otherwise mark this rule's fix as
safe. However, note that (although it's rare) the value of `__slots__`
could still be read by code outside of the module in which the
`__slots__` definition occurs, in which case this rule's fix could
theoretically cause breakage.
