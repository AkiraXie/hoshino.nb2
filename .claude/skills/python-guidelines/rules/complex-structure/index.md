Derived from the **[mccabe](../#mccabe-c90)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for functions with a high `McCabe` complexity.

## Why is this bad?

The `McCabe` complexity of a function is a measure of the complexity of
the control flow graph of the function. It is calculated by adding
one to the number of decision points in the function. A decision
point is a place in the code where the program has a choice of two
or more paths to follow.

Functions with a high complexity are hard to understand and maintain.

## Example

```python
def foo(a, b, c):
    if a:
        if b:
            if c:
                return 1
            else:
                return 2
        else:
            return 3
    else:
        return 4
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(a, b, c):
    if not a:
        return 4
    if not b:
        return 3
    if not c:
        return 2
    return 1
```
