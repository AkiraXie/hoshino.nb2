Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for code that updates a set with the contents of an iterable by
using a `for` loop to call `.add()` or `.discard()` on each element
separately.

## Why is this bad?

When adding or removing a batch of elements to or from a set, it's more
idiomatic to use a single method call rather than adding or removing
elements one by one.

## Example

```python
s = set()

for x in (1, 2, 3):
    s.add(x)

for x in (1, 2, 3):
    s.discard(x)
```

Use instead:

```python
s = set()

s.update((1, 2, 3))
s.difference_update((1, 2, 3))
```

## Fix safety

The fix will be marked as unsafe if applying the fix would delete any comments.
Otherwise, it is marked as safe.
