Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for consecutive `global` (or `nonlocal`) statements.

## Why is this bad?

The `global` and `nonlocal` keywords accepts multiple comma-separated names.
Instead of using multiple `global` (or `nonlocal`) statements for separate
variables, you can use a single statement to declare multiple variables at
once.

## Example

```python
def func():
    global x
    global y

    print(x, y)
```

Use instead:

```python
def func():
    global x, y

    print(x, y)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the statements contain comments.
