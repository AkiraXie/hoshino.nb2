Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for files missing a new line at the end of the file.

## Why is this bad?

Trailing blank lines in a file are superfluous.

However, the last line of the file should end with a newline.

## Example

```python
spam(1)
```

Use instead:

```python
spam(1)\n
```
