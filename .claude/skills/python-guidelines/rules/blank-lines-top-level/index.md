Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for missing blank lines between top level functions and classes.

## Why is this bad?

PEP 8 recommends exactly two blank lines between top level functions and classes.

The rule respects the [`lint.isort.lines-after-imports`](../../settings/#lint_isort_lines-after-imports) setting when
determining the required number of blank lines between top-level `import`
statements and function or class definitions for compatibility with isort.

## Example

```python
def func1():
    pass
def func2():
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
def func1():
    pass

def func2():
    pass
```

## Typing stub files (`.pyi`)

The typing style guide recommends to not use blank lines between classes and functions except to group
them. That's why this rule is not enabled in typing stub files.

## Options

- [`lint.isort.lines-after-imports`](../../settings/#lint_isort_lines-after-imports)
