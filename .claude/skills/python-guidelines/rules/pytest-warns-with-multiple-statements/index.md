Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.warns` context managers with multiple statements.

This rule allows `pytest.warns` bodies to contain `for`
loops with empty bodies (e.g., `pass` or `...` statements), to test
iterator behavior.

## Why is this bad?

When `pytest.warns` is used as a context manager and contains multiple
statements, it can lead to the test passing when it should instead fail.

A `pytest.warns` context manager should only contain a single
simple statement that triggers the expected warning.

## Example

```python
import pytest

def test_foo_warns():
    with pytest.warns(Warning):
        setup()  # False negative if setup triggers a warning but foo does not.
        foo()
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo_warns():
    setup()
    with pytest.warns(Warning):
        foo()
```
