Derived from the **[flake8-raise](../#flake8-raise-rse)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary parentheses on raised exceptions.

## Why is this bad?

If an exception is raised without any arguments, parentheses are not
required, as the `raise` statement accepts either an exception instance
or an exception class (which is then implicitly instantiated).

Removing the parentheses makes the code more concise.

## Known problems

Parentheses can only be omitted if the exception is a class, as opposed to
a function call. This rule isn't always capable of distinguishing between
the two.

For example, if you import a function `module.get_exception` from another
module, and `module.get_exception` returns an exception object, this rule will
incorrectly mark the parentheses in `raise module.get_exception()` as
unnecessary.

## Example

```python
raise TypeError()
```

Use instead:

```python
raise TypeError
```

## Fix Safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if removing the parentheses would also remove comments
or if it’s unclear whether the expression is a class or a function call.
