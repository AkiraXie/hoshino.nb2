Derived from the **[flake8-annotations](../#flake8-annotations-ann)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks that static methods have return type annotations.

## Why is this bad?

Type annotations are a good way to document the return types of functions. They also
help catch bugs, when used alongside a type checker, by ensuring that the types of
any returned values, and the types expected by callers, match expectation.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    @staticmethod
    def bar():
        return 1
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    @staticmethod
    def bar() -> int:
        return 1
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-annotations.suppress-none-returning`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-annotations_suppress-none-returning)
