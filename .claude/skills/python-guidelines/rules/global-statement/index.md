Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of `global` statements to update identifiers.

## Why is this bad?

Pylint discourages the use of `global` variables as global mutable
state is a common source of bugs and confusing behavior.

## Example

```python
var = 1

def foo():
    global var  # [global-statement]
    var = 10
    print(var)

foo()
print(var)
```

Use instead:

```python
var = 1

def foo():
    var = 10
    print(var)
    return var

var = foo()
print(var)
```
