Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `len` calls on sequences in a boolean test context.

## Why is this bad?

Empty sequences are considered false in a boolean context.
You can either remove the call to `len`
or compare the length against a scalar.

## Example

```python
fruits = ["orange", "apple"]
vegetables = []

if len(fruits):
    print(fruits)

if not len(vegetables):
    print(vegetables)
```

Use instead:

```python
fruits = ["orange", "apple"]
vegetables = []

if fruits:
    print(fruits)

if not vegetables:
    print(vegetables)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe when the `len` call includes a comment,
as the comment would be removed.

For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case:

```python
fruits = []
if len(
    fruits  # comment
):
    ...
```
