Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for explicit `raise StopIteration` in generator functions.

## Why is this bad?

Raising `StopIteration` in a generator function causes a `RuntimeError`
when the generator is iterated over.

Instead of `raise StopIteration`, use `return` in generator functions.

## Example

```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    raise StopIteration  # This causes RuntimeError at runtime
```

Use instead:

```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    return  # Use return instead
```
