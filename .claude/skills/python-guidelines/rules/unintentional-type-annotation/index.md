Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the unintentional use of type annotations.

## Why is this bad?

The use of a colon (`:`) in lieu of an assignment (`=`) can be syntactically valid, but
is almost certainly a mistake when used in a subscript or attribute assignment.

## Example

```python
a["b"]: 1
```

Use instead:

```python
a["b"] = 1
```
