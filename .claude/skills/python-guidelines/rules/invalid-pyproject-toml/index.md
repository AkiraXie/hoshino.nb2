## What it does

Checks for any pyproject.toml that does not conform to the schema from the relevant PEPs.

## Why is this bad?

Your project may contain invalid metadata or configuration without you noticing

## Example

```python
[project]
name = "crab"
version = "1.0.0"
authors = ["Ferris the Crab <[email protected]>"]
```

Use instead:

```python
[project]
name = "crab"
version = "1.0.0"
authors = [
  { name = "Ferris the Crab", email = "[email protected]" }
]
```
