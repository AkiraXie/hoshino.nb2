Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for indentation that uses tabs.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces), spaces are preferred over tabs (unless used to remain
consistent with code that is already indented with tabs).

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter). The
formatter enforces consistent indentation, making the rule redundant.

The rule is also incompatible with the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter) when using
`format.indent-style="tab"`.
