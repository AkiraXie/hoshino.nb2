Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for boolean expressions that contain multiple equality comparisons
to the same value.

## Why is this bad?

To check if an object is equal to any one of multiple values, it's more
concise to use the `in` operator with a tuple of values.

## Example

```python
if foo == x or foo == y:
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
if foo in (x, y):
    ...
```
