Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `CamelCase` imports that are aliased as acronyms.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) recommends naming conventions for classes, functions,
constants, and more. The use of inconsistent naming styles between
import and alias names may lead readers to expect an import to be of
another type (e.g., confuse a Python class with a constant).

Import aliases should thus follow the same naming style as the member
being imported.

Note that this rule is distinct from `camelcase-imported-as-constant`
to accommodate selective enforcement.

Also note that import aliases following an import convention according to the
[`lint.flake8-import-conventions.aliases`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-import-conventions_aliases) option are allowed.

## Example

```python
from example import MyClassName as MCN
```

Use instead:

```python
from example import MyClassName
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-import-conventions.aliases`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-import-conventions_aliases)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names)
