Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for imports that are not at the top of the file.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports), "imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any
module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants."

This rule makes an exception for both `sys.path` modifications (allowing for
`sys.path.insert`, `sys.path.append`, etc.) and `os.environ` modifications
between imports.

## Example

```python
"One string"
"Two string"
a = 1
import os
from sys import x
```

Use instead:

```python
import os
from sys import x

"One string"
"Two string"
a = 1
```

## Notebook behavior

For Jupyter notebooks, this rule checks for imports that are not at the top of a *cell*.
