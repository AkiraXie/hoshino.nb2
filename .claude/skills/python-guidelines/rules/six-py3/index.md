## What it does

Checks for uses of `six.PY3`.

## Why is this bad?

`six.PY3` will evaluate to `False` on Python 4 and greater. This is likely
unintended, and may cause code intended to run on Python 2 to run on Python 4
too.

Instead, use `not six.PY2` to validate that the current Python major version is
*not* equal to 2, to future-proof the code.

## Example

```python
import six

six.PY3  # `False` on Python 4.
```

Use instead:

```python
import six

not six.PY2  # `True` on Python 4.
```
