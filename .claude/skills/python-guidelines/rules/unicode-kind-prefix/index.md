Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the Unicode kind prefix (`u`) in strings.

## Why is this bad?

In Python 3, all strings are Unicode by default. The Unicode kind prefix is
unnecessary and should be removed to avoid confusion.

## Example

```python
u"foo"
```

Use instead:

```python
"foo"
```
