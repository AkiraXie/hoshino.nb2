Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `assert` statements whose test expression is a falsy value.

## Why is this bad?

`pytest.fail` conveys the intent more clearly than `assert falsy_value`.

## Example

```python
def test_foo():
    if some_condition:
        assert False, "some_condition was True"
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    if some_condition:
        pytest.fail("some_condition was True")
    ...
```
