Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for section headers in docstrings that do not begin with capital
letters.

## Why is this bad?

For stylistic consistency, all section headers in a docstring should be
capitalized.

Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by
a blank line, followed by a series of sections. Each section typically has
a header and a body.

This rule is enabled when using the `numpy` and `google` conventions, and
disabled when using the `pep257` convention.

## Example

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    raises:
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```

Use instead:

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises:
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```
