Derived from the **[pandas-vet](../#pandas-vet-pd)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `.ix` on Pandas objects.

## Why is this bad?

The `.ix` method is deprecated as its behavior is ambiguous. Specifically,
it's often unclear whether `.ix` is indexing by label or by ordinal position.

Instead, prefer the `.loc` method for label-based indexing, and `.iloc` for
ordinal indexing.

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd

students_df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
students_df.ix[0]  # 0th row or row with label 0?
```

Use instead:

```python
import pandas as pd

students_df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
students_df.iloc[0]  # 0th row.
```
