Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `tarfile.extractall`.

## Why is this bad?

Extracting archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection is
a security risk, as maliciously crafted archives may contain files that
will be written outside of the target directory. For example, the archive
could include files with absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or relative
paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../etc/passwd`).

On Python 3.12 and later, use `filter='data'` to prevent the most dangerous
security issues (see: [PEP 706](https://peps.python.org/pep-0706/#backporting-forward-compatibility)). On earlier versions, set the `members`
argument to a trusted subset of the archive's members.

## Example

```python
import tarfile
import tempfile

tar = tarfile.open(filename)
tar.extractall(path=tempfile.mkdtemp())
tar.close()
```
