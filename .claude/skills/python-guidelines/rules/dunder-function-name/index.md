Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for functions with "dunder" names (that is, names with two
leading and trailing underscores) that are not documented.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) recommends that only documented "dunder" methods are used:

> ..."magic" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled
> namespaces. E.g. `__init__`, `__import__` or `__file__`. Never invent
> such names; only use them as documented.

## Example

```python
def __my_function__():
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
def my_function():
    pass
```

## Options

- [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names)
