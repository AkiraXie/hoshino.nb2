Derived from the **[flake8-django](../#flake8-django-dj)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of `fields = "__all__"` in Django `ModelForm`
classes.

## Why is this bad?

If a `ModelForm` includes the `fields = "__all__"` attribute, any new
field that is added to the model will automatically be exposed for
modification.

## Example

```python
from django.forms import ModelForm

class PostForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = "__all__"
```

Use instead:

```python
from django.forms import ModelForm

class PostForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = ["title", "content"]
```
