Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `pathlib.Path` objects that are initialized with the current
directory.

## Why is this bad?

The `Path()` constructor defaults to the current directory, so passing it
in explicitly (as `"."`) is unnecessary.

## Example

```python
from pathlib import Path

_ = Path(".")
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

_ = Path()
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked unsafe if there are comments inside the parentheses, as applying
the fix will delete them.
