Derived from the **[flake8-pie](../#flake8-pie-pie)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `pass` statements and ellipsis (`...`) literals in
functions, classes, and other blocks.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, the `pass` statement and ellipsis (`...`) literal serve as
placeholders, allowing for syntactically correct empty code blocks. The
primary purpose of these nodes is to avoid syntax errors in situations
where a statement or expression is syntactically required, but no code
needs to be executed.

If a `pass` or ellipsis is present in a code block that includes at least
one other statement (even, e.g., a docstring), it is unnecessary and should
be removed.

## Example

```python
def func():
    """Placeholder docstring."""
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
def func():
    """Placeholder docstring."""
```

Or, given:

```python
def func():
    """Placeholder docstring."""
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def func():
    """Placeholder docstring."""
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe in the rare case that the `pass` or ellipsis
is followed by a string literal, since removal of the placeholder would convert the
subsequent string literal into a docstring.
