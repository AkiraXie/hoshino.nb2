Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `if` expressions that check against a negated condition.

## Why is this bad?

`if` expressions that check against a negated condition are more difficult
to read than `if` expressions that check against the condition directly.

## Example

```python
b if not a else a
```

Use instead:

```python
a if a else b
```
