## What it does

Checks for Python version comparisons that compare against a tuple of the
wrong length.

## Why is this bad?

Stub files support simple conditionals to test for differences in Python
versions and platforms. When comparing against `sys.version_info`, avoid
comparing against tuples of the wrong length, which can lead to unexpected
behavior.

## Example

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info[:2] == (3,): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info[0] == 3: ...
```
