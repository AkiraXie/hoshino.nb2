Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for mocked calls that use a dummy `lambda` function instead of
`return_value`.

## Why is this bad?

When patching calls, an explicit `return_value` better conveys the intent
than a `lambda` function, assuming the `lambda` does not use the arguments
passed to it.

`return_value` is also robust to changes in the patched function's
signature, and enables additional assertions to verify behavior. For
example, `return_value` allows for verification of the number of calls or
the arguments passed to the patched function via `assert_called_once_with`
and related methods.

## Example

```python
def test_foo(mocker):
    mocker.patch("module.target", lambda x, y: 7)
```

Use instead:

```python
def test_foo(mocker):
    mocker.patch("module.target", return_value=7)

    # If the lambda makes use of the arguments, no diagnostic is emitted.
    mocker.patch("module.other_target", lambda x, y: x)
```
