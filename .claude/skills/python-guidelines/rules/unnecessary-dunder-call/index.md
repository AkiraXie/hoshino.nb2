Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for explicit use of dunder methods, like `__str__` and `__add__`.

## Why is this bad?

Dunder names are not meant to be called explicitly and, in most cases, can
be replaced with builtins or operators.

## Fix safety

This fix is always unsafe. When replacing dunder method calls with operators
or builtins, the behavior can change in the following ways:

1. Types may implement only a subset of related dunder methods. Calling a
   missing dunder method directly returns `NotImplemented`, but using the
   equivalent operator raises a `TypeError`.

   ```python
   class C: pass
   c = C()
   c.__gt__(1)  # before fix: NotImplemented
   c > 1        # after fix: raises TypeError
   ```
2. Instance-assigned dunder methods are ignored by operators and builtins.

   ```python
   class C: pass
   c = C()
   c.__bool__ = lambda: False
   c.__bool__() # before fix: False
   bool(c)      # after fix: True
   ```
3. Even with built-in types, behavior can differ.

   ```python
   (1).__gt__(1.0)  # before fix: NotImplemented
   1 > 1.0          # after fix: False
   ```

## Example

```python
three = (3.0).__str__()
twelve = "1".__add__("2")

def is_greater_than_two(x: int) -> bool:
    return x.__gt__(2)
```

Use instead:

```python
three = str(3.0)
twelve = "1" + "2"

def is_greater_than_two(x: int) -> bool:
    return x > 2
```
