Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that `__all__`, `__match_args__`, and `__slots__` variables are
assigned to values when defined in stub files.

## Why is this bad?

Special variables like `__all__` have the same semantics in stub files
as they do in Python modules, and so should be consistent with their
runtime counterparts.

## Example

```python
__all__: list[str]
```

Use instead:

```python
__all__: list[str] = ["foo", "bar"]
```
