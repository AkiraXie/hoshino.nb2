Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for class methods that are not separated from the class's docstring
by a blank line.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) recommends the use of a blank line to separate a class's
docstring from its methods.

This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of
convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the `numpy` and `pep257`
conventions, and disabled when using the `google` convention.

## Example

```python
class PhotoMetadata:
    """Metadata about a photo."""
    def __init__(self, file: Path):
        ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class PhotoMetadata:
    """Metadata about a photo."""

    def __init__(self, file: Path):
        ...
```
