Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

**Warning: This rule has been removed and its documentation is only available for historical reasons.**

## Removal

This rule has been removed because marking fixtures that do not return a value with an underscore
isn't a practice recommended by the pytest community.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest` fixtures that do not return a value, but are not named
with a leading underscore.

## Why is this bad?

By convention, fixtures that don't return a value should be named with a
leading underscore, while fixtures that do return a value should not.

This rule ignores abstract fixtures and generators.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def patch_something(mocker):
    mocker.patch("module.object")

@pytest.fixture()
def use_context():
    with create_context():
        yield
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def _patch_something(mocker):
    mocker.patch("module.object")

@pytest.fixture()
def _use_context():
    with create_context():
        yield
```
