Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for simple `__iter__` methods that return `Generator`, and for
simple `__aiter__` methods that return `AsyncGenerator`.

## Why is this bad?

Using `(Async)Iterator` for these methods is simpler and more elegant. More
importantly, it also reflects the fact that the precise kind of iterator
returned from an `__iter__` method is usually an implementation detail that
could change at any time. Type annotations help define a contract for a
function; implementation details should not leak into that contract.

For example:

```python
from collections.abc import AsyncGenerator, Generator
from typing import Any

class CustomIterator:
    def __iter__(self) -> Generator:
        yield from range(42)

class CustomIterator2:
    def __iter__(self) -> Generator[str, Any, None]:
        yield from "abcdefg"
```

Use instead:

```python
from collections.abc import Iterator

class CustomIterator:
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator:
        yield from range(42)

class CustomIterator2:
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[str]:
        yield from "abdefg"
```

## Fix safety

This rule tries hard to avoid false-positive errors, and the rule's fix
should always be safe for `.pyi` stub files. However, there is a slightly
higher chance that a false positive might be emitted by this rule when
applied to runtime Python (`.py` files). As such, the fix is marked as
unsafe for any `__iter__` or `__aiter__` method in a `.py` file that has
more than two statements (including docstrings) in its body.
