Derived from the **[flake8-logging-format](../#flake8-logging-format-g)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for redundant `exc_info` keyword arguments in logging statements.

## Why is this bad?

`exc_info` is `True` by default for `logging.exception`, and `False` by
default for `logging.error`.

Passing `exc_info=True` to `logging.exception` calls is redundant, as is
passing `exc_info=False` to `logging.error` calls.

## Known problems

This rule detects uses of the `logging` module via a heuristic.
Specifically, it matches against:

- Uses of the `logging` module itself (e.g., `import logging; logging.info(...)`).
- Uses of `flask.current_app.logger` (e.g., `from flask import current_app; current_app.logger.info(...)`).
- Objects whose name starts with `log` or ends with `logger` or `logging`,
  when used in the same file in which they are defined (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger(); logger.info(...)`).
- Imported objects marked as loggers via the [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects) setting, which can be
  used to enforce these rules against shared logger objects (e.g., `from module import logger; logger.info(...)`,
  when [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects) is set to `["module.logger"]`).

## Example

```python
import logging

try:
    ...
except ValueError:
    logging.exception("Exception occurred", exc_info=True)
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

try:
    ...
except ValueError:
    logging.exception("Exception occurred")
```

## Options

- [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects)
