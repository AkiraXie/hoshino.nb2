Derived from the **[flake8-2020](../#flake8-2020-ytt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for equality comparisons against the major version returned by
`sys.version_info` (e.g., `sys.version_info[0] == 3` or `sys.version_info[0] != 3`).

## Why is this bad?

Using `sys.version_info[0] == 3` to verify that the major version is
Python 3 or greater will fail if the major version number is ever
incremented (e.g., to Python 4). This is likely unintended, as code
that uses this comparison is likely intended to be run on Python 2,
but would now run on Python 4 too. Similarly, using `sys.version_info[0] != 3`
to check for Python 2 will also fail if the major version number is
incremented.

Instead, use `>=` to check if the major version number is 3 or greater,
or `<` to check if the major version number is less than 3, to future-proof
the code.

## Example

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info[0] == 3:
    ...
else:
    print("Python 2")  # This will be printed on Python 4.
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info >= (3,):
    ...
else:
    print("Python 2")  # This will not be printed on Python 4.
```
