Derived from the **[flake8-datetimez](../#flake8-datetimez-dtz)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for usage of `datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp()`.

## Why is this bad?

Python datetime objects can be naive or timezone-aware. While an aware
object represents a specific moment in time, a naive object does not
contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other
datetime objects. Since this can lead to errors, it is recommended to
always use timezone-aware objects.

`datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp()` returns a naive datetime
object; instead, use `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(ts, tz=...)`
to create a timezone-aware object.

## Example

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(946684800)
```

Use instead:

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(946684800, tz=datetime.timezone.utc)
```

Or, on Python 3.11 and later:

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(946684800, tz=datetime.UTC)
```
