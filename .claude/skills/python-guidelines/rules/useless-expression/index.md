## What it does

Checks for useless expressions.

## Why is this bad?

Useless expressions have no effect on the program, and are often included
by mistake. Assign a useless expression to a variable, or remove it
entirely.

## Example

```python
1 + 1
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = 1 + 1
```

## Notebook behavior

For Jupyter Notebooks, this rule is not applied to the last top-level expression in a cell.
This is because it's common to have a notebook cell that ends with an expression,
which will result in the `repr` of the evaluated expression being printed as the cell's output.

## Known problems

This rule ignores expression types that are commonly used for their side
effects, such as function calls.

However, if a seemingly useless expression (like an attribute access) is
needed to trigger a side effect, consider assigning it to an anonymous
variable, to indicate that the return value is intentionally ignored.

For example, given:

```python
with errors.ExceptionRaisedContext():
    obj.attribute
```

Use instead:

```python
with errors.ExceptionRaisedContext():
    _ = obj.attribute
```
