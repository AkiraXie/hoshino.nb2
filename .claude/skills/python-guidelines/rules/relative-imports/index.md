Derived from the **[flake8-tidy-imports](../#flake8-tidy-imports-tid)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for relative imports.

## Why is this bad?

Absolute imports, or relative imports from siblings, are recommended by [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports):

> Absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable and tend to be better behaved...
>
> ```python
> import mypkg.sibling
> from mypkg import sibling
> from mypkg.sibling import example
> ```
>
> However, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to absolute imports,
> especially when dealing with complex package layouts where using absolute imports would be
> unnecessarily verbose:
>
> ```python
> from . import sibling
> from .sibling import example
> ```

## Example

```python
from .. import foo
```

Use instead:

```python
from mypkg import foo
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-tidy-imports.ban-relative-imports`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-tidy-imports_ban-relative-imports)
