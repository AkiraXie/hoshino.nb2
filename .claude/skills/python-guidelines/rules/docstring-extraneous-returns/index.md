Derived from the **[pydoclint](../#pydoclint-doc)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for function docstrings with unnecessary "Returns" sections.

## Why is this bad?

A function without an explicit `return` statement should not have a
"Returns" section in its docstring.

This rule is not enforced for abstract methods. It is also ignored for
"stub functions": functions where the body only consists of `pass`, `...`,
`raise NotImplementedError`, or similar.

## Example

```python
def say_hello(n: int) -> None:
    """Says hello to the user.

    Args:
        n: Number of times to say hello.

    Returns:
        Doesn't return anything.
    """
    for _ in range(n):
        print("Hello!")
```

Use instead:

```python
def say_hello(n: int) -> None:
    """Says hello to the user.

    Args:
        n: Number of times to say hello.
    """
    for _ in range(n):
        print("Hello!")
```
