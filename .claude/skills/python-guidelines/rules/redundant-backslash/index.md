Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for redundant backslashes between brackets.

## Why is this bad?

Explicit line joins using a backslash are redundant between brackets.

## Example

```python
x = (2 + \
    2)
```

Use instead:

```python
x = (2 +
    2)
```
