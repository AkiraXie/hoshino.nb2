Derived from the **[flake8-return](../#flake8-return-ret)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `else` statements with a `break` statement in the preceding `if`
block.

## Why is this bad?

The `else` statement is not needed, as the `break` statement will always
break out of the loop. Removing the `else` will reduce nesting and make the
code more readable.

## Example

```python
def foo(bar, baz):
    for i in bar:
        if i > baz:
            break
        else:
            x = 0
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(bar, baz):
    for i in bar:
        if i > baz:
            break
        x = 0
```
