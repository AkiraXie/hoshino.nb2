Derived from the **[flake8-type-checking](../#flake8-type-checking-tc)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks if [PEP 613](https://peps.python.org/pep-0613/) explicit type aliases contain references to
symbols that are not available at runtime.

## Why is this bad?

Referencing type-checking only symbols results in a `NameError` at runtime.

## Example

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, TypeAlias

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from foo import Foo
OptFoo: TypeAlias = Foo | None
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, TypeAlias

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from foo import Foo
OptFoo: TypeAlias = "Foo | None"
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is currently always marked as unsafe, since runtime
typing libraries may try to access/resolve the type alias in a way
that we can't statically determine during analysis and relies on the
type alias not containing any forward references.
