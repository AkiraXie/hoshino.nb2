Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of unused private `TypeVar`, `ParamSpec` or
`TypeVarTuple` declarations.

## Why is this bad?

A private `TypeVar` that is defined but not used is likely a mistake. It
should either be used, made public, or removed to avoid confusion. A type
variable is considered "private" if its name starts with an underscore.

## Example

```python
import typing
import typing_extensions

_T = typing.TypeVar("_T")
_Ts = typing_extensions.TypeVarTuple("_Ts")
```

## Fix safety

The fix is always marked as unsafe, as it would break your code if the type
variable is imported by another module.
