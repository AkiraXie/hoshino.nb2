Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for compound statements (multiple statements on the same line).

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations), "compound statements are generally discouraged".

## Example

```python
if foo == "blah": do_blah_thing()
```

Use instead:

```python
if foo == "blah":
    do_blah_thing()
```
