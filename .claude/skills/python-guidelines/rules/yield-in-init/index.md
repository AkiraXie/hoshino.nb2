Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `__init__` methods that are turned into generators by the
inclusion of `yield` or `yield from` expressions.

## Why is this bad?

The `__init__` method is the constructor for a given Python class,
responsible for initializing, rather than creating, new objects.

The `__init__` method has to return `None`. By including a `yield` or
`yield from` expression in an `__init__`, the method will return a
generator object when called at runtime, resulting in a runtime error.

## Example

```python
class InitIsGenerator:
    def __init__(self, i):
        yield i
```
