Derived from the **[flake8-slots](../#flake8-slots-slot)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for subclasses of `str` that lack a `__slots__` definition.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, the `__slots__` attribute allows you to explicitly define the
attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python
uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory
overhead. However, when `__slots__` is defined, Python uses a more compact
internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory
savings.

Subclasses of `str` inherit all the attributes and methods of the built-in
`str` class. Since strings are typically immutable, they don't require
additional attributes beyond what the `str` class provides. Defining
`__slots__` for subclasses of `str` prevents the creation of a dictionary
for each instance, reducing memory consumption.

## Example

```python
class Foo(str):
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo(str):
    __slots__ = ()
```
