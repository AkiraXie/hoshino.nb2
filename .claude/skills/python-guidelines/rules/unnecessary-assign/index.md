Derived from the **[flake8-return](../#flake8-return-ret)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for variable assignments that immediately precede a `return` of the
assigned variable.

## Why is this bad?

The variable assignment is not necessary, as the value can be returned
directly.

## Example

```python
def foo():
    bar = 1
    return bar
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo():
    return 1
```
