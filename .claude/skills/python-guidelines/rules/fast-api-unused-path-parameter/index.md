Derived from the **[FastAPI](../#fastapi-fast)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Identifies FastAPI routes that declare path parameters in the route path
that are not included in the function signature.

## Why is this bad?

Path parameters are used to extract values from the URL path.

If a path parameter is declared in the route path but not in the function
signature, it will not be accessible in the function body, which is likely
a mistake.

If a path parameter is declared in the route path, but as a positional-only
argument in the function signature, it will also not be accessible in the
function body, as FastAPI will not inject the parameter.

## Known problems

If the path parameter is *not* a valid Python identifier (e.g., `user-id`, as
opposed to `user_id`), FastAPI will normalize it. However, this rule simply
ignores such path parameters, as FastAPI's normalization behavior is undocumented.

## Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/things/{thing_id}")
async def read_thing(query: str): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/things/{thing_id}")
async def read_thing(thing_id: int, query: str): ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as modifying a function signature can
change the behavior of the code.
