Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `tuple` calls that take unnecessary list or tuple literals as
arguments. In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this also includes unnecessary list comprehensions
within tuple calls.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to use a list or tuple literal within a `tuple()` call,
since there is a literal syntax for these types.

If a list literal was passed, then it should be rewritten as a `tuple`
literal. Otherwise, if a tuple literal was passed, then the outer call
to `tuple()` should be removed.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule also checks for list comprehensions within `tuple()`
calls. If a list comprehension is found, it should be rewritten as a
generator expression.

## Example

```python
tuple([1, 2])
tuple((1, 2))
tuple([x for x in range(10)])
```

Use instead:

```python
(1, 2)
(1, 2)
tuple(x for x in range(10))
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
