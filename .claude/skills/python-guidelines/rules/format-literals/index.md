Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary positional indices in format strings.

## Why is this bad?

In Python 3.1 and later, format strings can use implicit positional
references. For example, `"{0}, {1}".format("Hello", "World")` can be
rewritten as `"{}, {}".format("Hello", "World")`.

If the positional indices appear exactly in-order, they can be omitted
in favor of automatic indices to improve readability.

## Example

```python
"{0}, {1}".format("Hello", "World")  # "Hello, World"
```

Use instead:

```python
"{}, {}".format("Hello", "World")  # "Hello, World"
```

This fix is marked as unsafe because:

- Comments attached to arguments are not moved, which can cause comments to mismatch the actual arguments.
- If arguments have side effects (e.g., print), reordering may change program behavior.
