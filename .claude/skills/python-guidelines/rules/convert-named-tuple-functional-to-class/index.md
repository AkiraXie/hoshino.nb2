Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `NamedTuple` declarations that use functional syntax.

## Why is this bad?

`NamedTuple` subclasses can be defined either through a functional syntax
(`Foo = NamedTuple(...)`) or a class syntax (`class Foo(NamedTuple): ...`).

The class syntax is more readable and generally preferred over the
functional syntax, which exists primarily for backwards compatibility
with `collections.namedtuple`.

## Example

```python
from typing import NamedTuple

Foo = NamedTuple("Foo", [("a", int), ("b", str)])
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Foo(NamedTuple):
    a: int
    b: str
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there are any comments within the
range of the `NamedTuple` definition, as these will be dropped by the
autofix.
