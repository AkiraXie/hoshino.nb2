Derived from the **[flake8-implicit-str-concat](../#flake8-implicit-str-concat-isc)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for implicitly concatenated strings that span multiple lines.

## Why is this bad?

For string literals that wrap across multiple lines, [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length) recommends
the use of implicit string concatenation within parentheses instead of
using a backslash for line continuation, as the former is more readable
than the latter.

By default, this rule will only trigger if the string literal is
concatenated via a backslash. To disallow implicit string concatenation
altogether, set the [`lint.flake8-implicit-str-concat.allow-multiline`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-implicit-str-concat_allow-multiline) option
to `false`.

## Example

```python
z = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy "\
    "dog."
```

Use instead:

```python
z = (
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy "
    "dog."
)
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-implicit-str-concat.allow-multiline`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-implicit-str-concat_allow-multiline)

## Formatter compatibility

Using this rule with `allow-multiline = false` can be incompatible with the
formatter because the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) can introduce new multi-line implicitly
concatenated strings. We recommend to either:

- Enable `ISC001` to disallow all implicit concatenated strings
- Setting `allow-multiline = true`
