Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for `dict.get(key, falsy_value)` calls in boolean test positions.

## Why is this bad?

The default fallback `None` is already falsy.

## Example

```python
if dict.get(key, False):
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
if dict.get(key):
    ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the `dict.get()` call contains comments between
arguments that will be deleted.

## Fix availability

This rule's fix is unavailable in cases where invalid arguments are provided to `dict.get`. As
shown in the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get), `dict.get` takes two positional-only arguments, so invalid cases
are identified by the presence of more than two arguments or any keyword arguments.
