Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for object type comparisons using `==` and other comparison
operators.

## Why is this bad?

Unlike a direct type comparison, `isinstance` will also check if an object
is an instance of a class or a subclass thereof.

If you want to check for an exact type match, use `is` or `is not`.

## Known problems

When using libraries that override the `==` (`__eq__`) operator (such as NumPy,
Pandas, and SQLAlchemy), this rule may produce false positives, as converting
from `==` to `is` or `is not` will change the behavior of the code.

For example, the following operations are *not* equivalent:

```python
import numpy as np

np.array([True, False]) == False
# array([False,  True])

np.array([True, False]) is False
# False
```

## Example

```python
if type(obj) == type(1):
    pass

if type(obj) == int:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
if isinstance(obj, int):
    pass
```
