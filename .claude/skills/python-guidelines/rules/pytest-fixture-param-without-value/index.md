Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest` test functions that should be decorated with
`@pytest.mark.usefixtures`.

## Why is this bad?

In `pytest`, fixture injection is used to activate fixtures in a test
function.

Fixtures can be injected either by passing them as parameters to the test
function, or by using the `@pytest.mark.usefixtures` decorator.

If the test function depends on the fixture being activated, but does not
use it in the test body or otherwise rely on its return value, prefer
the `@pytest.mark.usefixtures` decorator, to make the dependency explicit
and avoid the confusion caused by unused arguments.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def _patch_something(): ...

def test_foo(_patch_something): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def _patch_something(): ...

@pytest.mark.usefixtures("_patch_something")
def test_foo(): ...
```
