Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `if` statements that can be replaced with `min()` or `max()`
calls.

## Why is this bad?

An `if` statement that selects the lesser or greater of two sub-expressions
can be replaced with a `min()` or `max()` call respectively. Where possible,
prefer `min()` and `max()`, as they're more concise and readable than the
equivalent `if` statements.

## Example

```python
if score > highest_score:
    highest_score = score
```

Use instead:

```python
highest_score = max(highest_score, score)
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked unsafe if it would delete any comments within the replacement range.

An example to illustrate where comments are preserved and where they are not:

```python
a, b = 0, 10

if a >= b: # deleted comment
    # deleted comment
    a = b # preserved comment
```
