This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for imports of several unsafe cryptography modules.

## Why is this bad?

The `pycrypto` library is known to have a publicly disclosed buffer
overflow vulnerability. It is no longer actively maintained and has been
deprecated in favor of the `pyca/cryptography` library.

## Example

```python
import Crypto.Random
```
