Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for bare `raise` statements outside of exception handlers.

## Why is this bad?

A bare `raise` statement without an exception object will re-raise the last
exception that was active in the current scope, and is typically used
within an exception handler to re-raise the caught exception.

If a bare `raise` is used outside of an exception handler, it will generate
an error due to the lack of an active exception.

Note that a bare `raise` within a `finally` block will work in some cases
(namely, when the exception is raised within the `try` block), but should
be avoided as it can lead to confusing behavior.

## Example

```python
from typing import Any

def is_some(obj: Any) -> bool:
    if obj is None:
        raise
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import Any

def is_some(obj: Any) -> bool:
    if obj is None:
        raise ValueError("`obj` cannot be `None`")
```
