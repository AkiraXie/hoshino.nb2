Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `.split(os.sep)`

## Why is this bad?

The `pathlib` module in the standard library should be used for path
manipulation. It provides a high-level API with the functionality
needed for common operations on `Path` objects.

## Example

If not all parts of the path are needed, then the `name` and `parent`
attributes of the `Path` object should be used. Otherwise, the `parts`
attribute can be used as shown in the last example.

```python
import os

"path/to/file_name.txt".split(os.sep)[-1]

"path/to/file_name.txt".split(os.sep)[-2]

# Iterating over the path parts
if any(part in blocklist for part in "my/file/path".split(os.sep)):
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

Path("path/to/file_name.txt").name

Path("path/to/file_name.txt").parent.name

# Iterating over the path parts
if any(part in blocklist for part in Path("my/file/path").parts):
    ...
```

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than working directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.
