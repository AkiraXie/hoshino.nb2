Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for superfluous whitespace in blank lines.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations), "avoid trailing whitespace anywhere. Because it’s usually
invisible, it can be confusing"

## Example

```python
class Foo(object):\n    \n    bang = 12
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo(object):\n\n    bang = 12
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked unsafe if the whitespace is inside a multiline string,
as removing it changes the string's content.
