Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for the use of a staticmethod being made without the decorator.

## Why is this bad?

When it comes to consistency and readability, it's preferred to use the decorator.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    def bar(arg1, arg2): ...

    bar = staticmethod(bar)
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    @staticmethod
    def bar(arg1, arg2): ...
```
