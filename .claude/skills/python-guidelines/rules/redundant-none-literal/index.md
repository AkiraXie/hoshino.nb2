Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for redundant `Literal[None]` annotations.

## Why is this bad?

While `Literal[None]` is a valid type annotation, it is semantically equivalent to `None`.
Prefer `None` over `Literal[None]` for both consistency and readability.

## Example

```python
from typing import Literal

Literal[None]
Literal[1, 2, 3, "foo", 5, None]
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import Literal

None
Literal[1, 2, 3, "foo", 5] | None
```

## Fix safety and availability

This rule's fix is marked as safe unless the literal contains comments.

There is currently no fix available when applying the fix would lead to
a `TypeError` from an expression of the form `None | None` or when we
are unable to import the symbol `typing.Optional` and the Python version
is 3.9 or below.
