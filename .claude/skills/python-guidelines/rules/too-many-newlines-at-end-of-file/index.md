Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for files with multiple trailing blank lines.

In the case of notebooks, this check is applied to
each cell separately.

## Why is this bad?

Trailing blank lines in a file are superfluous.

However, the last line of the file should end with a newline.

## Example

```python
spam(1)\n\n\n
```

Use instead:

```python
spam(1)\n
```
