Derived from the **[flake8-future-annotations](../#flake8-future-annotations-fa)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of PEP 585- and PEP 604-style type annotations in Python
modules that lack the required `from __future__ import annotations` import
for compatibility with older Python versions.

## Why is this bad?

Using PEP 585 and PEP 604 style annotations without a `from __future__ import annotations` import will cause runtime errors on Python versions prior to
3.9 and 3.10, respectively.

By adding the `__future__` import, the interpreter will no longer interpret
annotations at evaluation time, making the code compatible with both past
and future Python versions.

This rule respects the [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version) setting. For example, if your
project targets Python 3.10 and above, adding `from __future__ import annotations`
does not impact your ability to leverage PEP 604-style unions (e.g., to
convert `Optional[str]` to `str | None`). As such, this rule will only
flag such usages if your project targets Python 3.9 or below.

## Example

```python
def func(obj: dict[str, int | None]) -> None: ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

def func(obj: dict[str, int | None]) -> None: ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as adding `from __future__ import annotations`
may change the semantics of the program.

## Options

- [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version)
