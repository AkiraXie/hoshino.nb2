Derived from the **[pygrep-hooks](../#pygrep-hooks-pgh)** linter.

**Warning: This rule has been removed and its documentation is only available for historical reasons.**

Fix is sometimes available.

## Removed

This rule is identical to [G010](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/logging-warn/) which should be used instead.

## What it does

Check for usages of the deprecated `warn` method from the `logging` module.

## Why is this bad?

The `warn` method is deprecated. Use `warning` instead.

## Example

```python
import logging

def foo():
    logging.warn("Something happened")
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

def foo():
    logging.warning("Something happened")
```
