Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that async functions do not open files with blocking methods like `open`.

## Why is this bad?

Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library
or function.

## Example

```python
async def foo():
    with open("bar.txt") as f:
        contents = f.read()
```

Use instead:

```python
import anyio

async def foo():
    async with await anyio.open_file("bar.txt") as f:
        contents = await f.read()
```
