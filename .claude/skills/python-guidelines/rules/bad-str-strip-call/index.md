Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks duplicate characters in `str.strip` calls.

## Why is this bad?

All characters in `str.strip` calls are removed from both the leading and
trailing ends of the string. Including duplicate characters in the call
is redundant and often indicative of a mistake.

In Python 3.9 and later, you can use `str.removeprefix` and
`str.removesuffix` to remove an exact prefix or suffix from a string,
respectively, which should be preferred when possible.

## Example

```python
# Evaluates to "foo".
"bar foo baz".strip("bar baz ")
```

Use instead:

```python
# Evaluates to "foo".
"bar foo baz".strip("abrz ")  # "foo"
```

Or:

```python
# Evaluates to "foo".
"bar foo baz".removeprefix("bar ").removesuffix(" baz")
```
