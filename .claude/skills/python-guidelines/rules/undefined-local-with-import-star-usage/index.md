Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for names that might be undefined, but may also be defined in a
wildcard import.

## Why is this bad?

Wildcard imports (e.g., `from module import *`) make it hard to determine
which symbols are available in the current namespace. If a module contains
a wildcard import, and a name in the current namespace has not been
explicitly defined or imported, then it's unclear whether the name is
undefined or was imported by the wildcard import.

If the name *is* defined in via a wildcard import, that member should be
imported explicitly to avoid confusion.

If the name is *not* defined in a wildcard import, it should be defined or
imported.

## Example

```python
from math import *

def area(radius):
    return pi * radius**2
```

Use instead:

```python
from math import pi

def area(radius):
    return pi * radius**2
```
