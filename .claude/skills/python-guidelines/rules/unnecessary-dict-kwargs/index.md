Derived from the **[flake8-pie](../#flake8-pie-pie)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `dict` kwargs.

## Why is this bad?

If the `dict` keys are valid identifiers, they can be passed as keyword
arguments directly, without constructing unnecessary dictionary.
This also makes code more type-safe as type checkers often cannot
precisely verify dynamic keyword arguments.

## Example

```python
def foo(bar):
    return bar + 1

print(foo(**{"bar": 2}))  # prints 3

# No typing errors, but results in an exception at runtime.
print(foo(**{"bar": 2, "baz": 3}))
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(bar):
    return bar + 1

print(foo(bar=2))  # prints 3

# Typing error detected: No parameter named "baz".
print(foo(bar=2, baz=3))
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe for dictionaries with comments interleaved between
the items, as comments may be removed.

For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case:

```python
foo(
    **{
        # comment
        "x": 1.0,
        # comment
        "y": 2.0,
    }
)
```

as this is converted to `foo(x=1.0, y=2.0)` without any of the comments.
