Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for `Literal[True, False]` type annotations.

## Why is this bad?

`Literal[True, False]` can be replaced with `bool` in type annotations,
which has the same semantic meaning but is more concise and readable.

`bool` type has exactly two constant instances: `True` and `False`. Static
type checkers such as [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/typeops.py#L985) treat `Literal[True, False]` as equivalent to
`bool` in a type annotation.

## Example

```python
from typing import Literal

x: Literal[True, False]
y: Literal[True, False, "hello", "world"]
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import Literal

x: bool
y: Literal["hello", "world"] | bool
```

## Fix safety

The fix for this rule is marked as unsafe, as it may change the semantics of the code.
Specifically:

- Type checkers may not treat `bool` as equivalent when overloading boolean arguments
  with `Literal[True]` and `Literal[False]` (see, e.g., [#14764](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14764) and [#5421](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/5421)).
- `bool` is not strictly equivalent to `Literal[True, False]`, as `bool` is
  a subclass of `int`, and this rule may not apply if the type annotations are used
  in a numeric context.

Further, the `Literal` slice may contain trailing-line comments which the fix would remove.
