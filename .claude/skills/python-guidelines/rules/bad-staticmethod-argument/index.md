Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for static methods that use `self` or `cls` as their first argument.
This rule also applies to `__new__` methods, which are implicitly static.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-method-arguments) recommends the use of `self` and `cls` as the first arguments for
instance methods and class methods, respectively. Naming the first argument
of a static method as `self` or `cls` can be misleading, as static methods
do not receive an instance or class reference as their first argument.

## Example

```python
class Wolf:
    @staticmethod
    def eat(self):
        pass
```

Use instead:

```python
class Wolf:
    @staticmethod
    def eat(sheep):
        pass
```
