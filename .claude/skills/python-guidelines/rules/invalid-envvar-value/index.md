Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `os.getenv` calls with an invalid `key` argument.

## Why is this bad?

`os.getenv` only supports strings as the first argument (`key`).

If the provided argument is not a string, `os.getenv` will throw a
`TypeError` at runtime.

## Example

```python
import os

os.getenv(1)
```

Use instead:

```python
import os

os.getenv("1")
```
