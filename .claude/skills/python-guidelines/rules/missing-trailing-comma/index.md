Derived from the **[flake8-commas](../#flake8-commas-com)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for the absence of trailing commas.

## Why is this bad?

The presence of a trailing comma can reduce diff size when parameters or
elements are added or removed from function calls, function definitions,
literals, etc.

## Example

```python
foo = {
    "bar": 1,
    "baz": 2
}
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = {
    "bar": 1,
    "baz": 2,
}
```

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/). The
formatter enforces consistent use of trailing commas, making the rule redundant.
