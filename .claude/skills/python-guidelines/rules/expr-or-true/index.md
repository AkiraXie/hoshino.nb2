Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `or` expressions that contain truthy values.

## Why is this bad?

If the expression is used as a condition, it can be replaced in-full with
`True`.

In other cases, the expression can be short-circuited to the first truthy
value.

By using `True` (or the first truthy value), the code is more concise
and easier to understand, since it no longer contains redundant conditions.

## Example

```python
if x or [1] or y:
    pass

a = x or [1] or y
```

Use instead:

```python
if True:
    pass

a = x or [1]
```
