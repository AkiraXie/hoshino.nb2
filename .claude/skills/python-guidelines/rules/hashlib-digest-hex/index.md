Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for the use of `.digest().hex()` on a hashlib hash, like `sha512`.

## Why is this bad?

When generating a hex digest from a hash, it's preferable to use the
`.hexdigest()` method, rather than calling `.digest()` and then `.hex()`,
as the former is more concise and readable.

## Example

```python
from hashlib import sha512

hashed = sha512(b"some data").digest().hex()
```

Use instead:

```python
from hashlib import sha512

hashed = sha512(b"some data").hexdigest()
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.
