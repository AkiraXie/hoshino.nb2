Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for calls to `ssl.wrap_socket()` without an `ssl_version`.

## Why is this bad?

This method is known to provide a default value that maximizes
compatibility, but permits use of insecure protocols.

## Example

```python
import ssl

ssl.wrap_socket()
```

Use instead:

```python
import ssl

ssl.wrap_socket(ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
```
