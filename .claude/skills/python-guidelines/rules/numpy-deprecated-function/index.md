Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of deprecated NumPy functions.

## Why is this bad?

When NumPy functions are deprecated, they are usually replaced with
newer, more efficient versions, or with functions that are more
consistent with the rest of the NumPy API.

Prefer newer APIs over deprecated ones.

## Example

```python
import numpy as np

np.alltrue([True, False])
```

Use instead:

```python
import numpy as np

np.all([True, False])
```
