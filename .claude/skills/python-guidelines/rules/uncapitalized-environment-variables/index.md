Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Check for environment variables that are not capitalized.

## Why is this bad?

By convention, environment variables should be capitalized.

On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive and are converted to
uppercase, so using lowercase environment variables can lead to subtle bugs.

## Example

```python
import os

os.environ["foo"]
```

Use instead:

```python
import os

os.environ["FOO"]
```

## Fix safety

This fix is always marked as unsafe because automatically capitalizing environment variable names
can change program behavior in environments where the variable names are case-sensitive, such as most
Unix-like systems.
