Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for a # symbol appearing on a line not followed by an actual comment.

## Why is this bad?

Empty comments don't provide any clarity to the code, and just add clutter.
Either add a comment or delete the empty comment.

## Example

```python
class Foo:  #
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    pass
```
