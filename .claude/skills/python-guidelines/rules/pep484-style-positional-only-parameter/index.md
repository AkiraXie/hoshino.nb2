Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#positional-only-arguments)-style positional-only parameters.

## Why is this bad?

Historically, [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#positional-only-arguments) recommended prefixing parameter names with double
underscores (`__`) to indicate to a type checker that they were
positional-only. However, [PEP 570](https://peps.python.org/pep-0570) (introduced in Python 3.8) introduced
dedicated syntax for positional-only arguments. If a forward slash (`/`) is
present in a function signature on Python 3.8+, all parameters prior to the
slash are interpreted as positional-only.

The new syntax should be preferred as it is more widely used, more concise
and more readable. It is also respected by Python at runtime, whereas the
old-style syntax was only understood by type checkers.

## Example

```python
def foo(__x: int) -> None: ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(x: int, /) -> None: ...
```

## Options

- [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version)
