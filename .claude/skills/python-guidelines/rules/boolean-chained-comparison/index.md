Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Check for chained boolean operations that can be simplified.

## Why is this bad?

Refactoring the code will improve readability for these cases.

## Example

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
if a < b and b < c:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
if a < b < c:
    pass
```
