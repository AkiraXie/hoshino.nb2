Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `bin(...).count("1")` to perform a population count.

## Why is this bad?

In Python 3.10, a `bit_count()` method was added to the `int` class,
which is more concise and efficient than converting to a binary
representation via `bin(...)`.

## Example

```python
x = bin(123).count("1")
y = bin(0b1111011).count("1")
```

Use instead:

```python
x = (123).bit_count()
y = 0b1111011.bit_count()
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe unless the argument to `bin` can be inferred as
an instance of a type that implements the `__index__` and `bit_count` methods because this can
change the exception raised at runtime for an invalid argument.
