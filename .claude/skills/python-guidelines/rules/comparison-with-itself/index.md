Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for operations that compare a name to itself.

## Why is this bad?

Comparing a name to itself always results in the same value, and is likely
a mistake.

## Example

```python
foo == foo
```

In some cases, self-comparisons are used to determine whether a float is
NaN. Instead, prefer `math.isnan`:

```python
import math

math.isnan(foo)
```
