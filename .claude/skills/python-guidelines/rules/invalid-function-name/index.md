Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for functions names that do not follow the `snake_case` naming
convention.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) recommends that function names follow `snake_case`:

> Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to
> improve readability. mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the
> prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

Names can be excluded from this rule using the [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
or [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names) configuration options. For example,
to ignore all functions starting with `test_` from this rule, set the
[`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names) option to `["test_*"]`.

This rule exempts methods decorated with [`@typing.override`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override).
Explicitly decorating a method with `@override` signals to Ruff that the method is intended
to override a superclass method, and that a type checker will enforce that it does so. Ruff
therefore knows that it should not enforce naming conventions on such methods.

## Example

```python
def myFunction():
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
def my_function():
    pass
```

## Options

- [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names)
