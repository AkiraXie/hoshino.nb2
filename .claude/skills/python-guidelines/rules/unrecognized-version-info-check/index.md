## What it does

Checks for problematic `sys.version_info`-related conditions in stubs.

## Why is this bad?

Stub files support simple conditionals to test for differences in Python
versions using `sys.version_info`. However, there are a number of common
mistakes involving `sys.version_info` comparisons that should be avoided.
For example, comparing against a string can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Example

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info[0] == "2": ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info[0] == 2: ...
```
