Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `os.path.abspath`.

## Why is this bad?

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to
the lower-level API offered by `os.path`. When possible, using `Path` object
methods such as `Path.resolve()` can improve readability over the `os.path`
module's counterparts (e.g., `os.path.abspath()`).

## Examples

```python
import os

file_path = os.path.abspath("../path/to/file")
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path("../path/to/file").resolve()
```

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.

## Fix Safety

This rule's fix is always marked as unsafe because `Path.resolve()` resolves symlinks, while
`os.path.abspath()` does not. If resolving symlinks is important, you may need to use
`Path.absolute()`. However, `Path.absolute()` also does not remove any `..` components in a
path, unlike `os.path.abspath()` and `Path.resolve()`, so if that specific combination of
behaviors is required, there's no existing `pathlib` alternative. See CPython issue
[#69200](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/69200).

Additionally, the fix is marked as unsafe because `os.path.abspath()` returns `str` or `bytes` (`AnyStr`),
while `Path.resolve()` returns a `Path` object. This change in return type can break code that uses
the return value.
