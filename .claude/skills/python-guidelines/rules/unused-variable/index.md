Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of unused variables in function scopes.

## Why is this bad?

A variable that is defined but not used is likely a mistake, and should
be removed to avoid confusion.

If a variable is intentionally defined-but-not-used, it should be
prefixed with an underscore, or some other value that adheres to the
[`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx) pattern.

## Example

```python
def foo():
    x = 1
    y = 2
    return x
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo():
    x = 1
    return x
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because removing an unused variable assignment may
delete comments that are attached to the assignment.

## See also

This rule does not apply to bindings in unpacked assignments (e.g. `x, y = 1, 2`). See
[`unused-unpacked-variable`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-unpacked-variable/) for this case.

## Options

- [`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx)
