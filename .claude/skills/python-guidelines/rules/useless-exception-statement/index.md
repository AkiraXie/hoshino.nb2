Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for an exception that is not raised.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to create an exception without raising it. For example,
`ValueError("...")` on its own will have no effect (unlike
`raise ValueError("...")`) and is likely a mistake.

## Known problems

This rule only detects built-in exceptions, like `ValueError`, and does
not catch user-defined exceptions.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also detect user-defined exceptions, but only
the ones defined in the file being checked.

## Example

```python
ValueError("...")
```

Use instead:

```python
raise ValueError("...")
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as converting a useless exception
statement to a `raise` statement will change the program's behavior.
