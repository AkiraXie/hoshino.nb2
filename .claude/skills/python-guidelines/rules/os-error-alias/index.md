Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of exceptions that alias `OSError`.

## Why is this bad?

`OSError` is the builtin error type used for exceptions that relate to the
operating system.

In Python 3.3, a variety of other exceptions, like `WindowsError` were
aliased to `OSError`. These aliases remain in place for compatibility with
older versions of Python, but may be removed in future versions.

Prefer using `OSError` directly, as it is more idiomatic and future-proof.

## Example

```python
raise IOError
```

Use instead:

```python
raise OSError
```
