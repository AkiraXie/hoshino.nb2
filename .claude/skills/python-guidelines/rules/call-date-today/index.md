Derived from the **[flake8-datetimez](../#flake8-datetimez-dtz)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for usage of `datetime.date.today()`.

## Why is this bad?

Python date objects are naive, that is, not timezone-aware. While an aware
object represents a specific moment in time, a naive object does not
contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other
datetime objects. Since this can lead to errors, it is recommended to
always use timezone-aware objects.

`datetime.date.today` returns a naive date object without taking timezones
into account. Instead, use `datetime.datetime.now(tz=...).date()` to
create a timezone-aware object and retrieve its date component.

## Example

```python
import datetime

datetime.date.today()
```

Use instead:

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc).date()
```

Or, for Python 3.11 and later:

```python
import datetime

datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.UTC).date()
```
