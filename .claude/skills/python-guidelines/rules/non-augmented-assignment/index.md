Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for assignments that can be replaced with augmented assignment
statements.

## Why is this bad?

If the right-hand side of an assignment statement consists of a binary
operation in which one operand is the same as the assignment target,
it can be rewritten as an augmented assignment. For example, `x = x + 1`
can be rewritten as `x += 1`.

When performing such an operation, an augmented assignment is more concise
and idiomatic.

## Known problems

In some cases, this rule will not detect assignments in which the target
is on the right-hand side of a binary operation (e.g., `x = y + x`, as
opposed to `x = x + y`), as such operations are not commutative for
certain data types, like strings.

For example, `x = "prefix-" + x` is not equivalent to `x += "prefix-"`,
while `x = 1 + x` is equivalent to `x += 1`.

If the type of the left-hand side cannot be trivially inferred, the rule
will ignore the assignment.

## Example

```python
x = x + 1
```

Use instead:

```python
x += 1
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as augmented assignments have
different semantics when the target is a mutable data type, like a list or
dictionary.

For example, consider the following:

```python
foo = [1]
bar = foo
foo = foo + [2]
assert (foo, bar) == ([1, 2], [1])
```

If the assignment is replaced with an augmented assignment, the update
operation will apply to both `foo` and `bar`, as they refer to the same
object:

```python
foo = [1]
bar = foo
foo += [2]
assert (foo, bar) == ([1, 2], [1, 2])
```
