Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for extraneous whitespace immediately preceding an open parenthesis
or bracket.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves), open parentheses and brackets should not be preceded
by any trailing whitespace.

## Example

```python
spam (1)
```

Use instead:

```python
spam(1)
```
