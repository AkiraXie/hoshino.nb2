Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary list comprehensions.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to use a list comprehension inside a call to `dict()`,
since there is an equivalent comprehension for this type.

## Example

```python
dict([(x, f(x)) for x in foo])
```

Use instead:

```python
{x: f(x) for x in foo}
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
