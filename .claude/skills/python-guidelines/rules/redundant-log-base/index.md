Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `math.log` calls with a redundant base.

## Why is this bad?

The default base of `math.log` is `e`, so specifying it explicitly is
redundant.

Instead of passing 2 or 10 as the base, use `math.log2` or `math.log10`
respectively, as these dedicated variants are typically more accurate
than `math.log`.

## Example

```python
import math

math.log(4, math.e)
math.log(4, 2)
math.log(4, 10)
```

Use instead:

```python
import math

math.log(4)
math.log2(4)
math.log10(4)
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked unsafe when the argument is a starred expression, as this changes
the call semantics and may raise runtime errors. It is also unsafe if comments are
present within the call, as they will be removed. Additionally, `math.log(x, base)`
and `math.log2(x)` / `math.log10(x)` may differ due to floating-point rounding, so
the fix is also unsafe when making this transformation.
