Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for missing blank lines between methods of a class.

## Why is this bad?

PEP 8 recommends exactly one blank line between methods of a class.

## Example

```python
class MyClass(object):
    def func1():
        pass
    def func2():
        pass
```

Use instead:

```python
class MyClass(object):
    def func1():
        pass

    def func2():
        pass
```

## Typing stub files (`.pyi`)

The typing style guide recommends to not use blank lines between methods except to group
them. That's why this rule is not enabled in typing stub files.
