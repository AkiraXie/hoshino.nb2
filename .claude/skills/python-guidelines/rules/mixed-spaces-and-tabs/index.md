Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for mixed tabs and spaces in indentation.

## Why is this bad?

Never mix tabs and spaces.

The most popular way of indenting Python is with spaces only. The
second-most popular way is with tabs only. Code indented with a
mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces
exclusively.

## Example

```python
if a == 0:\n        a = 1\n\tb = 1
```

Use instead:

```python
if a == 0:\n    a = 1\n    b = 1
```
