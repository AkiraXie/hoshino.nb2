Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.warns` calls without an expected warning.

## Why is this bad?

`pytest.warns` expects to receive an expected warning as its first
argument. If omitted, the `pytest.warns` call will fail at runtime.

## Example

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    with pytest.warns():
        do_something()
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    with pytest.warns(SomeWarning):
        do_something()
```
