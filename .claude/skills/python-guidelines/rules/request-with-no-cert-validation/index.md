## What it does

Checks for HTTPS requests that disable SSL certificate checks.

## Why is this bad?

If SSL certificates are not verified, an attacker could perform a "man in
the middle" attack by intercepting and modifying traffic between the client
and server.

## Example

```python
import requests

requests.get("https://www.example.com", verify=False)
```

Use instead:

```python
import requests

requests.get("https://www.example.com")  # By default, `verify=True`.
```
