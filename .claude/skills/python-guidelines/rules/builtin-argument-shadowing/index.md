Derived from the **[flake8-builtins](../#flake8-builtins-a)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for function arguments that use the same names as builtins.

## Why is this bad?

Reusing a builtin name for the name of an argument increases the
difficulty of reading and maintaining the code, and can cause
non-obvious errors, as readers may mistake the argument for the
builtin and vice versa.

Function definitions decorated with [`@override`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override) or
[`@overload`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.overload) are exempt from this rule by default.
Builtins can be marked as exceptions to this rule via the
[`lint.flake8-builtins.ignorelist`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_ignorelist) configuration option.

## Example

```python
def remove_duplicates(list, list2):
    result = set()
    for value in list:
        result.add(value)
    for value in list2:
        result.add(value)
    return list(result)  # TypeError: 'list' object is not callable
```

Use instead:

```python
def remove_duplicates(list1, list2):
    result = set()
    for value in list1:
        result.add(value)
    for value in list2:
        result.add(value)
    return list(result)
```
