Derived from the **[flake8-type-checking](../#flake8-type-checking-tc)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of string literals in `X | Y`-style union types.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 604](https://peps.python.org/pep-0604/) introduced a new syntax for union type annotations based on the
`|` operator.

While Python's type annotations can typically be wrapped in strings to
avoid runtime evaluation, the use of a string member within an `X | Y`-style
union type will cause a runtime error.

Instead, remove the quotes, wrap the *entire* union in quotes, or use
`from __future__ import annotations` to disable runtime evaluation of
annotations entirely.

## Example

```python
var: "Foo" | None

class Foo: ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

var: Foo | None

class Foo: ...
```

Or, extend the quotes to include the entire union:

```python
var: "Foo | None"

class Foo: ...
```
