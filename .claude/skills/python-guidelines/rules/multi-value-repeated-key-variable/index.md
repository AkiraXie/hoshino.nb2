Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for dictionary keys that are repeated with different values.

## Why is this bad?

Dictionary keys should be unique. If a key is repeated with a different
value, the first values will be overwritten and the key will correspond to
the last value. This is likely a mistake.

## Example

```python
foo = {
    bar: 1,
    baz: 2,
    baz: 3,
}
foo[baz]  # 3
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = {
    bar: 1,
    baz: 2,
}
foo[baz]  # 2
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because removing a repeated dictionary key
may delete comments that are attached to the removed key-value pair. This can also change
the program's behavior if the value expressions have side effects.
