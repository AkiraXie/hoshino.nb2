Derived from the **[flake8-django](../#flake8-django-dj)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of `exclude` in Django `ModelForm` classes.

## Why is this bad?

If a `ModelForm` includes the `exclude` attribute, any new field that
is added to the model will automatically be exposed for modification.

## Example

```python
from django.forms import ModelForm

class PostForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        exclude = ["author"]
```

Use instead:

```python
from django.forms import ModelForm

class PostForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Post
        fields = ["title", "content"]
```
