Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `+` operator to concatenate collections.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, the `+` operator can be used to concatenate collections (e.g.,
`x + y` to concatenate the lists `x` and `y`).

However, collections can be concatenated more efficiently using the
unpacking operator (e.g., `[*x, *y]` to concatenate `x` and `y`).

Prefer the unpacking operator to concatenate collections, as it is more
readable and flexible. The `*` operator can unpack any iterable, whereas
`+` operates only on particular sequences which, in many cases, must be of
the same type.

## Example

```python
foo = [2, 3, 4]
bar = [1] + foo + [5, 6]
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = [2, 3, 4]
bar = [1, *foo, 5, 6]
```

## Fix safety

The fix is always marked as unsafe because the `+` operator uses the `__add__` magic method and
`*`-unpacking uses the `__iter__` magic method. Both of these could have custom
implementations, causing the fix to change program behaviour.
