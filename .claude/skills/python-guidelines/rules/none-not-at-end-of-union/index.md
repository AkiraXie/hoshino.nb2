Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for type annotations where `None` is not at the end of an union.

## Why is this bad?

Type annotation unions are commutative, meaning that the order of the elements
does not matter. The `None` literal represents the absence of a value. For
readability, it's preferred to write the more informative type expressions first.

## Example

```python
def func(arg: None | int): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def func(arg: int | None): ...
```
