Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `subprocess.run` that set the `universal_newlines`
keyword argument.

## Why is this bad?

As of Python 3.7, the `universal_newlines` keyword argument has been
renamed to `text`, and now exists for backwards compatibility. The
`universal_newlines` keyword argument may be removed in a future version of
Python. Prefer `text`, which is more explicit and readable.

## Example

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run(["foo"], universal_newlines=True)
```

Use instead:

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run(["foo"], text=True)
```
