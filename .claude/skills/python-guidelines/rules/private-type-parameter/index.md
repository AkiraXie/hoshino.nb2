Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for use of [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) type parameters with leading underscores in generic classes and
functions.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) type parameters are already restricted in scope to the class or function in which they
appear, so leading underscores just hurt readability without the usual privacy benefits.

However, neither a diagnostic nor a fix will be emitted for "sunder" (`_T_`) or "dunder"
(`__T__`) type parameter names as these are not considered private.

## Example

```python
class GenericClass[_T]:
    var: _T

def generic_function[_T](var: _T) -> list[_T]:
    return var[0]
```

Use instead:

```python
class GenericClass[T]:
    var: T

def generic_function[T](var: T) -> list[T]:
    return var[0]
```

## Fix availability

If the name without an underscore would shadow a builtin or another variable, would be a
keyword, or would otherwise be an invalid identifier, a fix will not be available. In these
situations, you can consider using a trailing underscore or a different name entirely to satisfy
the lint rule.

This rule renames private [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) type parameters but doesn't convert pre-[PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) generics
to the new format. See [`non-pep695-generic-function`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-pep695-generic-function) and
[`non-pep695-generic-class`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-pep695-generic-class) for rules that will make this transformation.
Those rules do not remove unused type variables after their changes,
so you may also want to consider enabling [`unused-private-type-var`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-private-type-var) to complete
the transition to [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) generics.
