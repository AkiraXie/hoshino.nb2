Derived from the **[Airflow](../#airflow-air)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of Airflow functions and values that have been moved to its providers
(e.g., `apache-airflow-providers-fab`).

## Why is this bad?

Airflow 3.0 moved various deprecated functions, members, and other
values to its providers. The user needs to install the corresponding provider and replace
the original usage with the one in the provider.

## Example

```python
from airflow.auth.managers.fab.fab_auth_manager import FabAuthManager

fab_auth_manager_app = FabAuthManager().get_fastapi_app()
```

Use instead:

```python
from airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.fab_auth_manager import FabAuthManager

fab_auth_manager_app = FabAuthManager().get_fastapi_app()
```
