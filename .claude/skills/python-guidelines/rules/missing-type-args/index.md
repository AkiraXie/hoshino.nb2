Derived from the **[flake8-annotations](../#flake8-annotations-ann)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that function `*args` arguments have type annotations.

## Why is this bad?

Type annotations are a good way to document the types of function arguments. They also
help catch bugs, when used alongside a type checker, by ensuring that the types of
any provided arguments match expectation.

## Example

```python
def foo(*args): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(*args: int): ...
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-annotations.suppress-dummy-args`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-annotations_suppress-dummy-args)
