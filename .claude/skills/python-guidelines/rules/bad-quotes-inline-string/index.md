Derived from the **[flake8-quotes](../#flake8-quotes-q)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for inline strings that use single quotes or double quotes,
depending on the value of the [`lint.flake8-quotes.inline-quotes`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-quotes_inline-quotes) option.

## Why is this bad?

Consistency is good. Use either single or double quotes for inline
strings, but be consistent.

## Example

```python
foo = 'bar'
```

Assuming `inline-quotes` is set to `double`, use instead:

```python
foo = "bar"
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-quotes.inline-quotes`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-quotes_inline-quotes)

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter). The
formatter enforces consistent quotes for inline strings, making the rule
redundant.
