Derived from the **[flake8-boolean-trap](../#flake8-boolean-trap-fbt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of boolean positional arguments in function definitions,
as determined by the presence of a boolean default value.

## Why is this bad?

Calling a function with boolean positional arguments is confusing as the
meaning of the boolean value is not clear to the caller and to future
readers of the code.

The use of a boolean will also limit the function to only two possible
behaviors, which makes the function difficult to extend in the future.

Instead, consider refactoring into separate implementations for the
`True` and `False` cases, using an `Enum`, or making the argument a
keyword-only argument, to force callers to be explicit when providing
the argument.

This rule exempts methods decorated with [`@typing.override`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override),
since changing the signature of a subclass method that overrides a
superclass method may cause type checkers to complain about a violation of
the Liskov Substitution Principle.

## Example

```python
from math import ceil, floor

def round_number(number, up=True):
    return ceil(number) if up else floor(number)

round_number(1.5, True)  # What does `True` mean?
round_number(1.5, False)  # What does `False` mean?
```

Instead, refactor into separate implementations:

```python
from math import ceil, floor

def round_up(number):
    return ceil(number)

def round_down(number):
    return floor(number)

round_up(1.5)
round_down(1.5)
```

Or, refactor to use an `Enum`:

```python
from enum import Enum

class RoundingMethod(Enum):
    UP = 1
    DOWN = 2

def round_number(value, method):
    return ceil(number) if method is RoundingMethod.UP else floor(number)

round_number(1.5, RoundingMethod.UP)
round_number(1.5, RoundingMethod.DOWN)
```

Or, make the argument a keyword-only argument:

```python
from math import ceil, floor

def round_number(number, *, up=True):
    return ceil(number) if up else floor(number)

round_number(1.5, up=True)
round_number(1.5, up=False)
```
