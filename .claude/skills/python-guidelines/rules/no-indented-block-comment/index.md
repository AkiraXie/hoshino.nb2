Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for comments in a code blocks that are lacking indentation.

## Why is this bad?

Comments within an indented block should themselves be indented, to
indicate that they are part of the block.

## Example

```python
for item in items:
# Hi
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
for item in items:
    # Hi
    pass
```
