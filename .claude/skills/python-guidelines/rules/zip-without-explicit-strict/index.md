Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `zip` calls without an explicit `strict` parameter when called with two or more iterables, or any starred argument.

## Why is this bad?

By default, if the iterables passed to `zip` are of different lengths, the
resulting iterator will be silently truncated to the length of the shortest
iterable. This can lead to subtle bugs.

Pass `strict=True` to raise a `ValueError` if the iterables are of
non-uniform length. Alternatively, if the iterables are deliberately of
different lengths, pass `strict=False` to make the intention explicit.

## Example

```python
zip(a, b)
```

Use instead:

```python
zip(a, b, strict=True)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe. While adding `strict=False` preserves
the runtime behavior, it can obscure situations where the iterables are of
unequal length. Ruff prefers to alert users so they can choose the intended
behavior themselves.
