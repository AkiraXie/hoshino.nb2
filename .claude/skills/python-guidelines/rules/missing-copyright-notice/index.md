Derived from the **[flake8-copyright](../#flake8-copyright-cpy)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for the absence of copyright notices within Python files.

Note that this check only searches within the first 4096 bytes of the file.

## Why is this bad?

In some codebases, it's common to have a license header at the top of every
file. This rule ensures that the license header is present.

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-copyright.author`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-copyright_author)
- [`lint.flake8-copyright.min-file-size`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-copyright_min-file-size)
- [`lint.flake8-copyright.notice-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-copyright_notice-rgx)
