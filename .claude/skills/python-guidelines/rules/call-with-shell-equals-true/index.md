Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for method calls that set the `shell` parameter to `true` or another
truthy value when invoking a subprocess.

## Why is this bad?

Setting the `shell` parameter to `true` or another truthy value when
invoking a subprocess can introduce security vulnerabilities, as it allows
shell metacharacters and whitespace to be passed to child processes,
potentially leading to shell injection attacks.

It is recommended to avoid using `shell=True` unless absolutely necessary
and, when used, to ensure that all inputs are properly sanitized and quoted
to prevent such vulnerabilities.

## Known problems

Prone to false positives as it is triggered on any function call with a
`shell=True` parameter.

## Example

```python
import my_custom_subprocess

user_input = input("Enter a command: ")
my_custom_subprocess.run(user_input, shell=True)
```
