Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `request.addfinalizer` usages in `pytest` fixtures.

## Why is this bad?

`pytest` offers two ways to perform cleanup in fixture code. The first is
sequential (via the `yield` statement), the second callback-based (via
`request.addfinalizer`).

The sequential approach is more readable and should be preferred, unless
the fixture uses the "factory as fixture" pattern.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def my_fixture(request):
    resource = acquire_resource()
    request.addfinalizer(resource.release)
    return resource
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def my_fixture():
    resource = acquire_resource()
    yield resource
    resource.release()

# "factory-as-fixture" pattern
@pytest.fixture()
def my_factory(request):
    def create_resource(arg):
        resource = acquire_resource(arg)
        request.addfinalizer(resource.release)
        return resource

    return create_resource
```
