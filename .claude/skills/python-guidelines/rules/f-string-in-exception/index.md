Derived from the **[flake8-errmsg](../#flake8-errmsg-em)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for the use of f-strings in exception constructors.

## Why is this bad?

Python includes the `raise` in the default traceback (and formatters
like Rich and IPython do too).

By using an f-string, the error message will be duplicated in the
traceback, which can make the traceback less readable.

## Example

Given:

```python
sub = "Some value"
raise RuntimeError(f"{sub!r} is incorrect")
```

Python will produce a traceback like:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tmp.py", line 2, in <module>
    raise RuntimeError(f"{sub!r} is incorrect")
RuntimeError: 'Some value' is incorrect
```

Instead, assign the string to a variable:

```python
sub = "Some value"
msg = f"{sub!r} is incorrect"
raise RuntimeError(msg)
```

Which will produce a traceback like:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tmp.py", line 3, in <module>
    raise RuntimeError(msg)
RuntimeError: 'Some value' is incorrect
```
