Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

**Warning: This rule has been removed and its documentation is only available for historical reasons.**

Fix is always available.

## Removed

This rule was removed as using [PEP 604](https://peps.python.org/pep-0604/) syntax in `isinstance` and `issubclass` calls
isn't recommended practice, and it incorrectly suggests that other typing syntaxes like [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/)
would be supported by `isinstance` and `issubclass`. Using the [PEP 604](https://peps.python.org/pep-0604/) syntax
is also slightly slower.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `isinstance` and `issubclass` that take a tuple
of types for comparison.

## Why is this bad?

Since Python 3.10, `isinstance` and `issubclass` can be passed a
`|`-separated union of types, which is consistent
with the union operator introduced in [PEP 604](https://peps.python.org/pep-0604/).

Note that this results in slower code. Ignore this rule if the
performance of an `isinstance` or `issubclass` check is a
concern, e.g., in a hot loop.

## Example

```python
isinstance(x, (int, float))
```

Use instead:

```python
isinstance(x, int | float)
```

## Options
