Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for functions in stub (`.pyi`) files that contain multiple
statements.

## Why is this bad?

Stub files are never executed, and are only intended to define type hints.
As such, functions in stub files should not contain functional code, and
should instead contain only a single statement (e.g., `...`).

## Example

```python
def function():
    x = 1
    y = 2
    return x + y
```

Use instead:

```python
def function(): ...
```
