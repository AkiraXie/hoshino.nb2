Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of mutable objects as `ContextVar` defaults.

## Why is this bad?

The `ContextVar` default is evaluated once, when the `ContextVar` is defined.

The same mutable object is then shared across all `.get()` method calls to
the `ContextVar`. If the object is modified, those modifications will persist
across calls, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Instead, prefer to use immutable data structures. Alternatively, take
`None` as a default, and initialize a new mutable object inside for each
call using the `.set()` method.

Types outside the standard library can be marked as immutable with the
[`lint.flake8-bugbear.extend-immutable-calls`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-bugbear_extend-immutable-calls) configuration option.

## Example

```python
from contextvars import ContextVar

cv: ContextVar[list] = ContextVar("cv", default=[])
```

Use instead:

```python
from contextvars import ContextVar

cv: ContextVar[list | None] = ContextVar("cv", default=None)

...

if cv.get() is None:
    cv.set([])
```
