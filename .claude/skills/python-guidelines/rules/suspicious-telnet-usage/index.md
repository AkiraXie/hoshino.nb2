Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of Telnet-related functions.

## Why is this bad?

Telnet is considered insecure because it does not encrypt data sent over
the connection and is vulnerable to numerous attacks.

Instead, consider using a more secure protocol such as SSH.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to Telnet-related functions.
