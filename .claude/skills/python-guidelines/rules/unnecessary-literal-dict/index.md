Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary list or tuple literals.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to use a list or tuple literal within a call to `dict()`.
It can be rewritten as a dict literal (`{}`).

## Example

```python
dict([(1, 2), (3, 4)])
dict(((1, 2), (3, 4)))
dict([])
```

Use instead:

```python
{1: 2, 3: 4}
{1: 2, 3: 4}
{}
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
