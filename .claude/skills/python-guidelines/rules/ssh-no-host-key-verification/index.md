## What it does

Checks for uses of policies disabling SSH verification in Paramiko.

## Why is this bad?

By default, Paramiko checks the identity of the remote host when establishing
an SSH connection. Disabling the verification might lead to the client
connecting to a malicious host, without the client knowing.

## Example

```python
from paramiko import client

ssh_client = client.SSHClient()
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(client.AutoAddPolicy)
```

Use instead:

```python
from paramiko import client

ssh_client = client.SSHClient()
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(client.RejectPolicy)
```
