Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for the use of extraneous whitespace before ",", ";" or ":".

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#pet-peeves) recommends the omission of whitespace in the following cases:

- "Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces."
- "Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon."

## Example

```python
if x == 4: print(x, y); x, y = y , x
```

Use instead:

```python
if x == 4: print(x, y); x, y = y, x
```
