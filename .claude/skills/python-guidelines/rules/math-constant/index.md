Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for literals that are similar to constants in `math` module.

## Why is this bad?

Hard-coding mathematical constants like π increases code duplication,
reduces readability, and may lead to a lack of precision.

## Example

```python
A = 3.141592 * r**2
```

Use instead:

```python
A = math.pi * r**2
```
