Derived from the **[flake8-pie](../#flake8-pie-pie)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `startswith` or `endswith` calls on the same value with
different prefixes or suffixes.

## Why is this bad?

The `startswith` and `endswith` methods accept tuples of prefixes or
suffixes respectively. Passing a tuple of prefixes or suffixes is more
efficient and readable than calling the method multiple times.

## Example

```python
msg = "Hello, world!"
if msg.startswith("Hello") or msg.startswith("Hi"):
    print("Greetings!")
```

Use instead:

```python
msg = "Hello, world!"
if msg.startswith(("Hello", "Hi")):
    print("Greetings!")
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is unsafe, as in some cases, it will be unable to determine
whether the argument to an existing `.startswith` or `.endswith` call is a
tuple. For example, given `msg.startswith(x) or msg.startswith(y)`, if `x`
or `y` is a tuple, and the semantic model is unable to detect it as such,
the rule will suggest `msg.startswith((x, y))`, which will error at
runtime.
