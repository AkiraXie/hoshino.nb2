## What it does

Checks for comparisons against NaN values.

## Why is this bad?

Comparing against a NaN value can lead to unexpected results. For example,
`float("NaN") == float("NaN")` will return `False` and, in general,
`x == float("NaN")` will always return `False`, even if `x` is `NaN`.

To determine whether a value is `NaN`, use `math.isnan` or `np.isnan`
instead of comparing against `NaN` directly.

## Example

```python
if x == float("NaN"):
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
import math

if math.isnan(x):
    pass
```
