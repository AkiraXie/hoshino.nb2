Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `assert expression, print(message)`.

## Why is this bad?

If an `assert x, y` assertion fails, the Python interpreter raises an
`AssertionError`, and the evaluated value of `y` is used as the contents of
that assertion error. The `print` function always returns `None`, however,
so the evaluated value of a call to `print` will always be `None`.

Using a `print` call in this context will therefore output the message to
`stdout`, before raising an empty `AssertionError(None)`. Instead, remove
the `print` and pass the message directly as the second expression,
allowing `stderr` to capture the message in a well-formatted context.

## Example

```python
assert False, print("This is a message")
```

Use instead:

```python
assert False, "This is a message"
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as changing the second expression
will result in a different `AssertionError` message being raised, as well as
a change in `stdout` output.
