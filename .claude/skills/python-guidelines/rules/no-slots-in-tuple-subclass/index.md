Derived from the **[flake8-slots](../#flake8-slots-slot)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for subclasses of `tuple` that lack a `__slots__` definition.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, the `__slots__` attribute allows you to explicitly define the
attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python
uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory
overhead. However, when `__slots__` is defined, Python uses a more compact
internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory
savings.

Subclasses of `tuple` inherit all the attributes and methods of the
built-in `tuple` class. Since tuples are typically immutable, they don't
require additional attributes beyond what the `tuple` class provides.
Defining `__slots__` for subclasses of `tuple` prevents the creation of a
dictionary for each instance, reducing memory consumption.

## Example

```python
class Foo(tuple):
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo(tuple):
    __slots__ = ()
```
