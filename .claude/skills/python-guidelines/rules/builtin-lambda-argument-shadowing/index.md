Derived from the **[flake8-builtins](../#flake8-builtins-a)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for lambda arguments that use the same names as Python builtins.

## Why is this bad?

Reusing a builtin name for the name of a lambda argument increases the
difficulty of reading and maintaining the code and can cause
non-obvious errors. Readers may mistake the variable for the
builtin, and vice versa.

Builtins can be marked as exceptions to this rule via the
[`lint.flake8-builtins.ignorelist`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_ignorelist) configuration option.

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-builtins.ignorelist`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_ignorelist)
