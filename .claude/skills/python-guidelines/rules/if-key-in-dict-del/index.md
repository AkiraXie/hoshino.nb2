Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `if key in dictionary: del dictionary[key]`.

## Why is this bad?

To remove a key-value pair from a dictionary, it's more concise to use `.pop(..., None)`.

## Example

```python
if key in dictionary:
    del dictionary[key]
```

Use instead:

```python
dictionary.pop(key, None)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the if statement contains comments.
