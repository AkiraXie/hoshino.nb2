Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `set.remove` that can be replaced with `set.discard`.

## Why is this bad?

If an element should be removed from a set if it is present, it is more
succinct and idiomatic to use `discard`.

## Known problems

This rule is prone to false negatives due to type inference limitations,
as it will only detect sets that are instantiated as literals or annotated
with a type annotation.

## Example

```python
nums = {123, 456}

if 123 in nums:
    nums.remove(123)
```

Use instead:

```python
nums = {123, 456}

nums.discard(123)
```
