Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `map()` calls with lambda functions.

## Why is this bad?

Using `map(func, iterable)` when `func` is a lambda is slower than
using a generator expression or a comprehension, as the latter approach
avoids the function call overhead, in addition to being more readable.

This rule also applies to `map()` calls within `list()`, `set()`, and
`dict()` calls. For example:

- Instead of `list(map(lambda num: num * 2, nums))`, use
  `[num * 2 for num in nums]`.
- Instead of `set(map(lambda num: num % 2 == 0, nums))`, use
  `{num % 2 == 0 for num in nums}`.
- Instead of `dict(map(lambda v: (v, v ** 2), values))`, use
  `{v: v ** 2 for v in values}`.

## Example

```python
map(lambda x: x + 1, iterable)
```

Use instead:

```python
(x + 1 for x in iterable)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
