## What it does

Checks for `break`, `continue`, and `return` statements in `finally`
blocks.

## Why is this bad?

The use of `break`, `continue`, and `return` statements in `finally` blocks
can cause exceptions to be silenced.

`finally` blocks execute regardless of whether an exception is raised. If a
`break`, `continue`, or `return` statement is reached in a `finally` block,
any exception raised in the `try` or `except` blocks will be silenced.

## Example

```python
def speed(distance, time):
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        raise ValueError("Time cannot be zero")
    finally:
        return 299792458  # `ValueError` is silenced
```

Use instead:

```python
def speed(distance, time):
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        raise ValueError("Time cannot be zero")
```
