Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `global` variables that are not assigned a value in the current
scope.

## Why is this bad?

The `global` keyword allows an inner scope to modify a variable declared
in the outer scope. If the variable is not modified within the inner scope,
there is no need to use `global`.

## Example

```python
DEBUG = True

def foo():
    global DEBUG
    if DEBUG:
        print("foo() called")
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
DEBUG = True

def foo():
    if DEBUG:
        print("foo() called")
    ...
```
