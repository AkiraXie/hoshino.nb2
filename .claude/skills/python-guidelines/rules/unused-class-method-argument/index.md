Derived from the **[flake8-unused-arguments](../#flake8-unused-arguments-arg)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of unused arguments in class method definitions.

## Why is this bad?

An argument that is defined but not used is likely a mistake, and should
be removed to avoid confusion.

If a variable is intentionally defined-but-not-used, it should be
prefixed with an underscore, or some other value that adheres to the
[`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx) pattern.

This rule exempts methods decorated with [`@typing.override`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override).
Removing a parameter from a subclass method (or changing a parameter's
name) may cause type checkers to complain about a violation of the Liskov
Substitution Principle if it means that the method now incompatibly
overrides a method defined on a superclass. Explicitly decorating an
overriding method with `@override` signals to Ruff that the method is
intended to override a superclass method and that a type checker will
enforce that it does so; Ruff therefore knows that it should not enforce
rules about unused arguments on such methods.

## Example

```python
class Class:
    @classmethod
    def foo(cls, arg1, arg2):
        print(arg1)
```

Use instead:

```python
class Class:
    @classmethod
    def foo(cls, arg1):
        print(arg1)
```

## Options

- [`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx)
