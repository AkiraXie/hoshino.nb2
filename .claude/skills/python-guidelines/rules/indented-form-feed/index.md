This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for form feed characters preceded by either a space or a tab.

## Why is this bad?

[The language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation) states:

> A formfeed character may be present at the start of the line;
> it will be ignored for the indentation calculations above.
> Formfeed characters occurring elsewhere in the leading whitespace
> have an undefined effect (for instance, they may reset the space count to zero).

## Example

```python
if foo():\n    \fbar()
```

Use instead:

```python
if foo():\n    bar()
```
