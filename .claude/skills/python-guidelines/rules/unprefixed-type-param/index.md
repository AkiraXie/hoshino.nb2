Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that type `TypeVar`s, `ParamSpec`s, and `TypeVarTuple`s in stubs
have names prefixed with `_`.

## Why is this bad?

Prefixing type parameters with `_` avoids accidentally exposing names
internal to the stub.

## Example

```python
from typing import TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import TypeVar

_T = TypeVar("_T")
```
