Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of unused `self` parameter in methods definitions.

## Why is this bad?

Unused `self` parameters are usually a sign of a method that could be
replaced by a function, class method, or static method.

This rule exempts methods decorated with [`@typing.override`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override).
Converting an instance method into a static method or class method may
cause type checkers to complain about a violation of the Liskov
Substitution Principle if it means that the method now incompatibly
overrides a method defined on a superclass. Explicitly decorating an
overriding method with `@override` signals to Ruff that the method is
intended to override a superclass method and that a type checker will
enforce that it does so; Ruff therefore knows that it should not enforce
rules about unused `self` parameters on such methods.

## Example

```python
class Person:
    def greeting(self):
        print("Greetings friend!")
```

Use instead:

```python
def greeting():
    print("Greetings friend!")
```

or

```python
class Person:
    @staticmethod
    def greeting():
        print("Greetings friend!")
```

## Options

The rule will not trigger on methods that are already marked as static or class methods.
