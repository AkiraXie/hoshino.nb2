Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for extraneous blank line(s) after function decorators.

## Why is this bad?

There should be no blank lines between a decorator and the object it is decorating.

## Example

```python
class User(object):

    @property

    def name(self):
        pass
```

Use instead:

```python
class User(object):

    @property
    def name(self):
        pass
```
