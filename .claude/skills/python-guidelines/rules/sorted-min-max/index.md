Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `sorted()` to retrieve the minimum or maximum value in
a sequence.

## Why is this bad?

Using `sorted()` to compute the minimum or maximum value in a sequence is
inefficient and less readable than using `min()` or `max()` directly.

## Example

```python
nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
lowest = sorted(nums)[0]
highest = sorted(nums)[-1]
highest = sorted(nums, reverse=True)[0]
```

Use instead:

```python
nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
lowest = min(nums)
highest = max(nums)
```

## Fix safety

In some cases, migrating to `min` or `max` can lead to a change in behavior,
notably when breaking ties.

As an example, `sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0), reverse=True)[0]` will return
the *last* "minimum" element in the list, if there are multiple elements with
the same key. However, `min(data, key=itemgetter(0))` will return the *first*
"minimum" element in the list in the same scenario.

As such, this rule's fix is marked as unsafe.
