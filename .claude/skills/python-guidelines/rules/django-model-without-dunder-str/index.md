Derived from the **[flake8-django](../#flake8-django-dj)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that a `__str__` method is defined in Django models.

## Why is this bad?

Django models should define a `__str__` method to return a string representation
of the model instance, as Django calls this method to display the object in
the Django Admin and elsewhere.

Models without a `__str__` method will display a non-meaningful representation
of the object in the Django Admin.

## Example

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    field = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

Use instead:

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    field = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.field}"
```
