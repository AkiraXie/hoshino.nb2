Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of non-ASCII characters in variable names.

## Why is this bad?

The use of non-ASCII characters in variable names can cause confusion
and compatibility issues (see: [PEP 672](https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/)).

## Example

```python
ápple_count: int
```

Use instead:

```python
apple_count: int
```
