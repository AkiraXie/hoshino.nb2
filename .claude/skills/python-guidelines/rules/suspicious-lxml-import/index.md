Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

**Warning: This rule has been removed and its documentation is only available for historical reasons.**

## Removed

This rule was removed as the `lxml` library has been modified to address
known vulnerabilities and unsafe defaults. As such, the `defusedxml`
library is no longer necessary, `defusedxml` has [deprecated](https://github.com/tiran/defusedxml/blob/c7445887f5e1bcea470a16f61369d29870cfcfe1/README.md#defusedxmllxml) its `lxml`
module.

## What it does

Checks for imports of the `lxml` module.

## Why is this bad?

Using various methods from the `lxml` module to parse untrusted XML data is
known to be vulnerable to XML attacks. Replace vulnerable imports with the
equivalent `defusedxml` package.

## Example

```python
import lxml
```
