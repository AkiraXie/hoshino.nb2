Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for strings that contain the zero width space character.

## Why is this bad?

This character is rendered invisibly in some text editors and terminals.

By using the `\u200B` sequence, the string will contain the same value,
but will render visibly in all editors.

## Example

```python
x = "Dear Sir/Madam"
```

Use instead:

```python
x = "Dear Sir\u200b/\u200bMadam"  # zero width space
```
