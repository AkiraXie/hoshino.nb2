Derived from the **[Perflint](../#perflint-perf)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `for` loops that can be replaced by a list comprehension.

## Why is this bad?

When creating a transformed list from an existing list using a for-loop,
prefer a list comprehension. List comprehensions are more readable and
more performant.

Using the below as an example, the list comprehension is ~10% faster on
Python 3.11, and ~25% faster on Python 3.10.

Note that, as with all `perflint` rules, this is only intended as a
micro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in
most cases.

## Example

```python
original = list(range(10000))
filtered = []
for i in original:
    if i % 2:
        filtered.append(i)
```

Use instead:

```python
original = list(range(10000))
filtered = [x for x in original if x % 2]
```

If you're appending to an existing list, use the `extend` method instead:

```python
original = list(range(10000))
filtered.extend(x for x in original if x % 2)
```
