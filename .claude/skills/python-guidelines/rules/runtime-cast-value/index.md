Derived from the **[flake8-type-checking](../#flake8-type-checking-tc)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unquoted type expressions in `typing.cast()` calls.

## Why is this bad?

This rule helps enforce a consistent style across your codebase.

It's often necessary to quote the first argument passed to `cast()`,
as type expressions can involve forward references, or references
to symbols which are only imported in `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` blocks.
This can lead to a visual inconsistency across different `cast()` calls,
where some type expressions are quoted but others are not. By enabling
this rule, you ensure that all type expressions passed to `cast()` are
quoted, enforcing stylistic consistency across all of your `cast()` calls.

In some cases where `cast()` is used in a hot loop, this rule may also
help avoid overhead from repeatedly evaluating complex type expressions at
runtime.

## Example

```python
from typing import cast

x = cast(dict[str, int], foo)
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import cast

x = cast("dict[str, int]", foo)
```

## Fix safety

This fix is safe as long as the type expression doesn't span multiple
lines and includes comments on any of the lines apart from the last one.
