Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `print` calls with unnecessary empty strings as positional
arguments and unnecessary `sep` keyword arguments.

## Why is this bad?

Prefer calling `print` without any positional arguments, which is
equivalent and more concise.

Similarly, when printing one or fewer items, the `sep` keyword argument,
(used to define the string that separates the `print` arguments) can be
omitted, as it's redundant when there are no items to separate.

## Example

```python
print("")
```

Use instead:

```python
print()
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked as unsafe if it removes comments or an unused `sep` keyword argument
that may have side effects. Removing such arguments may change the program's
behavior by skipping the execution of those side effects.
