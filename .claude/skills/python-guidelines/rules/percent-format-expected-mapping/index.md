## What it does

Checks for named placeholders in `printf`-style format strings without
mapping-type values.

## Why is this bad?

When using named placeholders in `printf`-style format strings, the values
must be a map type (such as a dictionary). Otherwise, the expression will
raise a `TypeError`.

## Example

```python
"%(greeting)s, %(name)s" % ("Hello", "World")
```

Use instead:

```python
"%(greeting)s, %(name)s" % {"greeting": "Hello", "name": "World"}
```

Or:

```python
"%s, %s" % ("Hello", "World")
```
