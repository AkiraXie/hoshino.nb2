Derived from the **[pandas-vet](../#pandas-vet-pd)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `.stack` on Pandas objects.

## Why is this bad?

Prefer `.melt` to `.stack`, which has the same functionality but with
support for direct column renaming and no dependence on `MultiIndex`.

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd

cities_df = pd.read_csv("cities.csv")
cities_df.set_index("city").stack()
```

Use instead:

```python
import pandas as pd

cities_df = pd.read_csv("cities.csv")
cities_df.melt(id_vars="city")
```
