Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Reports the following `re` and `regex` calls when
their first arguments are not raw strings:

- For `regex` and `re`: `compile`, `findall`, `finditer`,
  `fullmatch`, `match`, `search`, `split`, `sub`, `subn`.
- `regex`-specific: `splititer`, `subf`, `subfn`, `template`.

## Why is this bad?

Regular expressions should be written
using raw strings to avoid double escaping.

## Fix safety

The fix is unsafe if the string/bytes literal contains an escape sequence because the fix alters
the runtime value of the literal while retaining the regex semantics.

For example

```python
# Literal is `1\n2`.
re.compile("1\n2")

# Literal is `1\\n2`, but the regex library will interpret `\\n` and will still match a newline
# character as before.
re.compile(r"1\n2")
```

## Fix availability

A fix is not available if either

- the argument is a string with a (no-op) `u` prefix (e.g., `u"foo"`) as the prefix is
  incompatible with the raw prefix `r`
- the argument is a string or bytes literal with an escape sequence that has a different
  meaning in the context of a regular expression such as `\b`, which is word boundary or
  backspace in a regex, depending on the context, but always a backspace in string and bytes
  literals.

## Example

```python
re.compile("foo\\bar")
```

Use instead:

```python
re.compile(r"foo\bar")
```
