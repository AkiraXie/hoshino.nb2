Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of weak or broken cryptographic hash functions in
`hashlib` and `crypt` libraries.

## Why is this bad?

Weak or broken cryptographic hash functions may be susceptible to
collision attacks (where two different inputs produce the same hash) or
pre-image attacks (where an attacker can find an input that produces a
given hash). This can lead to security vulnerabilities in applications
that rely on these hash functions.

Avoid using weak or broken cryptographic hash functions in security
contexts. Instead, use a known secure hash function such as SHA256.

Note: This rule targets the following weak algorithm names in `hashlib`:
`md4`, `md5`, `sha`, and `sha1`. It also flags uses of `crypt.crypt` and
`crypt.mksalt` when configured with `METHOD_CRYPT`, `METHOD_MD5`, or
`METHOD_BLOWFISH`.

It does not attempt to lint OpenSSL- or platform-specific aliases and OIDs
(for example: `"sha-1"`, `"ssl3-sha1"`, `"ssl3-md5"`, or
`"1.3.14.3.2.26"`), nor variations with trailing spaces, as the set of
accepted aliases depends on the underlying OpenSSL version and varies across
platforms and Python builds.

## Example

```python
import hashlib

def certificate_is_valid(certificate: bytes, known_hash: str) -> bool:
    hash = hashlib.md5(certificate).hexdigest()
    return hash == known_hash
```

Use instead:

```python
import hashlib

def certificate_is_valid(certificate: bytes, known_hash: str) -> bool:
    hash = hashlib.sha256(certificate).hexdigest()
    return hash == known_hash
```

or add `usedforsecurity=False` if the hashing algorithm is not used in a security context, e.g.
as a non-cryptographic one-way compression function:

```python
import hashlib

def certificate_is_valid(certificate: bytes, known_hash: str) -> bool:
    hash = hashlib.md5(certificate, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
    return hash == known_hash
```
