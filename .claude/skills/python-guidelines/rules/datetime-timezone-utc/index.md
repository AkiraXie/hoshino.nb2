Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `datetime.timezone.utc`.

## Why is this bad?

As of Python 3.11, `datetime.UTC` is an alias for `datetime.timezone.utc`.
The alias is more readable and generally preferred over the full path.

## Example

```python
import datetime

datetime.timezone.utc
```

Use instead:

```python
import datetime

datetime.UTC
```
