Derived from the **[flake8-django](../#flake8-django-dj)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of `locals()` in `render` functions.

## Why is this bad?

Using `locals()` can expose internal variables or other unintentional
data to the rendered template.

## Example

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def index(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, "app/index.html", locals())
```

Use instead:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def index(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    context = {"posts": posts}
    return render(request, "app/index.html", context)
```
