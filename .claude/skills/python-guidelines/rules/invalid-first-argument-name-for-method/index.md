Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for instance methods that use a name other than `self` for their
first argument.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-method-arguments) recommends the use of `self` as first argument for all instance
methods:

> Always use self for the first argument to instance methods.
>
> If a function argument’s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to
> append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption.
> Thus `class_` is better than `clss`. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.)

Names can be excluded from this rule using the [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
or [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names) configuration options. For example,
to allow the use of `this` as the first argument to instance methods, set
the [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names) option to `["this"]`.

## Example

```python
class Example:
    def function(cls, data): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class Example:
    def function(self, data): ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as renaming a method parameter
can change the behavior of the program.

## Options

- [`lint.pep8-naming.classmethod-decorators`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_classmethod-decorators)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.staticmethod-decorators`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_staticmethod-decorators)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names)
