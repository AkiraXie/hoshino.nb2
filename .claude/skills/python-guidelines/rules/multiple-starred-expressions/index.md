Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of multiple starred expressions in assignment statements.

## Why is this bad?

In assignment statements, starred expressions can be used to unpack iterables.
Including more than one starred expression on the left-hand-side of an
assignment will cause a `SyntaxError`, as it is unclear which expression
should receive the remaining values.

## Example

```python
*foo, *bar, baz = (1, 2, 3)
```
