Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `py.path` library.

## Why is this bad?

The `py.path` library is in maintenance mode. Instead, prefer the standard
library's `pathlib` module, or third-party modules like `path` (formerly
`py.path`).

## Examples

```python
import py.path

p = py.path.local("/foo/bar").join("baz/qux")
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

p = Path("/foo/bar") / "bar" / "qux"
```
