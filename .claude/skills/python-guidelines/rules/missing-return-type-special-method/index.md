Derived from the **[flake8-annotations](../#flake8-annotations-ann)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks that "special" methods, like `__init__`, `__new__`, and `__call__`, have
return type annotations.

## Why is this bad?

Type annotations are a good way to document the return types of functions. They also
help catch bugs, when used alongside a type checker, by ensuring that the types of
any returned values, and the types expected by callers, match expectation.

Note that type checkers often allow you to omit the return type annotation for
`__init__` methods, as long as at least one argument has a type annotation. To
opt in to this behavior, use the `mypy-init-return` setting in your `pyproject.toml`
or `ruff.toml` file:

```python
[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-annotations]
mypy-init-return = true
```

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, x: int):
        self.x = x
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.x = x
```

## Options
