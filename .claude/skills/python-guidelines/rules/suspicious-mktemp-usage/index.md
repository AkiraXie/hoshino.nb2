## What it does

Checks for uses of `tempfile.mktemp`.

## Why is this bad?

`tempfile.mktemp` returns a pathname of a file that does not exist at the
time the call is made; then, the caller is responsible for creating the
file and subsequently using it. This is insecure because another process
could create a file with the same name between the time the function
returns and the time the caller creates the file.

`tempfile.mktemp` is deprecated in favor of `tempfile.mkstemp` which
creates the file when it is called. Consider using `tempfile.mkstemp`
instead, either directly or via a context manager such as
`tempfile.TemporaryFile`.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to `tempfile.mktemp`.

## Example

```python
import tempfile

tmp_file = tempfile.mktemp()
with open(tmp_file, "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
```

Use instead:

```python
import tempfile

with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
```
