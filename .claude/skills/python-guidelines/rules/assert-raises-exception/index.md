Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `assertRaises` and `pytest.raises` context managers that catch
`Exception` or `BaseException`.

## Why is this bad?

These forms catch every `Exception`, which can lead to tests passing even
if, e.g., the code under consideration raises a `SyntaxError` or
`IndentationError`.

Either assert for a more specific exception (builtin or custom), or use
`assertRaisesRegex` or `pytest.raises(..., match=<REGEX>)` respectively.

## Example

```python
self.assertRaises(Exception, foo)
```

Use instead:

```python
self.assertRaises(SomeSpecificException, foo)
```
