Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for dictionary literals that associate multiple values with the
same key.

## Why is this bad?

Dictionary keys should be unique. If a key is associated with multiple values,
the earlier values will be overwritten. Including multiple values for the
same key in a dictionary literal is likely a mistake.

## Example

```python
foo = {
    "bar": 1,
    "baz": 2,
    "baz": 3,
}
foo["baz"]  # 3
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = {
    "bar": 1,
    "baz": 2,
}
foo["baz"]  # 2
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because removing a repeated dictionary key
may delete comments that are attached to the removed key-value pair. This can also change
the program's behavior if the value expressions have side effects.
