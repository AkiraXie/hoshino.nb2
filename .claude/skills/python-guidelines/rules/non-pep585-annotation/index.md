Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for the use of generics that can be replaced with standard library
variants based on [PEP 585](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/).

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 585](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) enabled collections in the Python standard library (like `list`)
to be used as generics directly, instead of importing analogous members
from the `typing` module (like `typing.List`).

When available, the [PEP 585](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) syntax should be used instead of importing
members from the `typing` module, as it's more concise and readable.
Importing those members from `typing` is considered deprecated as of [PEP
585](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/).

This rule is enabled when targeting Python 3.9 or later (see:
[`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version)). By default, it's *also* enabled for earlier Python
versions if `from __future__ import annotations` is present, as
`__future__` annotations are not evaluated at runtime. If your code relies
on runtime type annotations (either directly or via a library like
Pydantic), you can disable this behavior for Python versions prior to 3.9
by setting [`lint.pyupgrade.keep-runtime-typing`](../../settings/#lint_pyupgrade_keep-runtime-typing) to `true`.

## Example

```python
from typing import List

foo: List[int] = [1, 2, 3]
```

Use instead:

```python
foo: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may lead to runtime errors when
alongside libraries that rely on runtime type annotations, like Pydantic,
on Python versions prior to Python 3.9.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule can also add its own `__future__` import on Python
3.9 and earlier, if the [`lint.future-annotations`](../../settings/#lint_future-annotations) setting is enabled. This
also makes the fix unsafe.

## Options

- [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version)
- [`lint.pyupgrade.keep-runtime-typing`](../../settings/#lint_pyupgrade_keep-runtime-typing)
- [`lint.future-annotations`](../../settings/#lint_future-annotations)
