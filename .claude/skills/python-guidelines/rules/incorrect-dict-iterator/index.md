Derived from the **[Perflint](../#perflint-perf)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `dict.items()` that discard either the key or the value
when iterating over the dictionary.

## Why is this bad?

If you only need the keys or values of a dictionary, you should use
`dict.keys()` or `dict.values()` respectively, instead of `dict.items()`.
These specialized methods are more efficient than `dict.items()`, as they
avoid allocating tuples for every item in the dictionary. They also
communicate the intent of the code more clearly.

Note that, as with all `perflint` rules, this is only intended as a
micro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in
most cases.

## Example

```python
obj = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
for key, value in obj.items():
    print(value)
```

Use instead:

```python
obj = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
for value in obj.values():
    print(value)
```

## Fix safety

The fix does not perform any type analysis and, as such, may suggest an
incorrect fix if the object in question does not duck-type as a mapping
(e.g., if it is missing a `.keys()` or `.values()` method, or if those
methods behave differently than they do on standard mapping types).
