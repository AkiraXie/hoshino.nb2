Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `__init__` methods that return values.

## Why is this bad?

The `__init__` method is the constructor for a given Python class,
responsible for initializing, rather than creating, new objects.

The `__init__` method has to return `None`. Returning any value from
an `__init__` method will result in a runtime error.

## Example

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        return []
```

Use instead:

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = []
```
