Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that async functions do not contain blocking HTTP calls.

## Why is this bad?

Blocking an async function via a blocking HTTP call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
HTTP response, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead of making a blocking HTTP call, use an asynchronous HTTP client
library such as `aiohttp` or `httpx`.

## Example

```python
import urllib

async def fetch():
    urllib.request.urlopen("https://example.com/foo/bar").read()
```

Use instead:

```python
import aiohttp

async def fetch():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://example.com/foo/bar") as resp:
            ...
```
