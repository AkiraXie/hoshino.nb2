Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `os.path.splitext`.

## Why is this bad?

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to
the lower-level API offered by `os.path`. When possible, using `Path` object
methods such as `Path.suffix` and `Path.stem` can improve readability over
the `os.path` module's counterparts (e.g., `os.path.splitext()`).

`os.path.splitext()` specifically returns a tuple of the file root and
extension (e.g., given `splitext('/foo/bar.py')`, `os.path.splitext()`
returns `("foo/bar", ".py")`. These outputs can be reconstructed through a
combination of `Path.suffix` (`".py"`), `Path.stem` (`"bar"`), and
`Path.parent` (`"foo"`).

## Examples

```python
import os

(root, ext) = os.path.splitext("foo/bar.py")
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("foo/bar.py")
root = path.parent / path.stem
ext = path.suffix
```

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.
