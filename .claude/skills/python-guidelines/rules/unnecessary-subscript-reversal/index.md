Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary subscript reversal of iterable.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to reverse the order of an iterable when passing it
into `reversed()`, `set()` or `sorted()` functions as they will change
the order of the elements again.

## Example

```python
sorted(iterable[::-1])
set(iterable[::-1])
reversed(iterable[::-1])
```

Use instead:

```python
sorted(iterable)
set(iterable)
iterable
```
