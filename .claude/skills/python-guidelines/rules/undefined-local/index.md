Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for undefined local variables.

## Why is this bad?

Referencing a local variable before it has been assigned will raise
an `UnboundLocalError` at runtime.

## Example

```python
x = 1

def foo():
    x += 1
```

Use instead:

```python
x = 1

def foo():
    global x
    x += 1
```
