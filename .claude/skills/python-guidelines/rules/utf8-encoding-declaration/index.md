Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary UTF-8 encoding declarations.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 3120](https://peps.python.org/pep-3120/) makes UTF-8 the default encoding, so a UTF-8 encoding
declaration is unnecessary.

## Example

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
print("Hello, world!")
```

Use instead:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
