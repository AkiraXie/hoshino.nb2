Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for identity comparisons using `not {foo} is {bar}`.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations), testing for an object's identity with `is not` is more
readable.

## Example

```python
if not X is Y:
    pass
Z = not X.B is Y
```

Use instead:

```python
if X is not Y:
    pass
Z = X.B is not Y
```
