Derived from the **[isort](../#isort-i)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

De-duplicates, groups, and sorts imports based on the provided `isort` settings.

## Why is this bad?

Consistency is good. Use a common convention for imports to make your code
more readable and idiomatic.

## Example

```python
import pandas
import numpy as np
```

Use instead:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas
```
