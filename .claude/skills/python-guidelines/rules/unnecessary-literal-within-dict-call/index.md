Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `dict()` calls that take unnecessary dict literals or dict
comprehensions as arguments.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to wrap a dict literal or comprehension within a `dict()`
call, since the literal or comprehension syntax already returns a
dictionary.

## Example

```python
dict({})
dict({"a": 1})
```

Use instead:

```python
{}
{"a": 1}
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
