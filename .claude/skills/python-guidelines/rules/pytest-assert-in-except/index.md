Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `assert` statements in `except` clauses.

## Why is this bad?

When testing for exceptions, `pytest.raises()` should be used instead of
`assert` statements in `except` clauses, as it's more explicit and
idiomatic. Further, `pytest.raises()` will fail if the exception is *not*
raised, unlike the `assert` statement.

## Example

```python
def test_foo():
    try:
        1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        assert e.args
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError) as exc_info:
        1 / 0
    assert exc_info.value.args
```

Or, for pytest 8.4.0 and later:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError, check=lambda e: e.args):
        1 / 0
```
