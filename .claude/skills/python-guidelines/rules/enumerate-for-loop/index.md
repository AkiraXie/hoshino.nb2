Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `for` loops with explicit loop-index variables that can be replaced
with `enumerate()`.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule checks for index variables initialized with any integer rather than only
a literal zero.

## Why is this bad?

When iterating over a sequence, it's often desirable to keep track of the
index of each element alongside the element itself. Prefer the `enumerate`
builtin over manually incrementing a counter variable within the loop, as
`enumerate` is more concise and idiomatic.

## Example

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"{i + 1}. {fruit}")
    i += 1
```

Use instead:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{i + 1}. {fruit}")
```
