## Removed

There's no [evidence](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12754) that generators are
meaningfully faster than list comprehensions when combined with unpacking.

## What it does

Checks for list comprehensions that are immediately unpacked.

## Why is this bad?

There is no reason to use a list comprehension if the result is immediately
unpacked. Instead, use a generator expression, which avoids allocating
an intermediary list.

## Example

```python
a, b, c = [foo(x) for x in items]
```

Use instead:

```python
a, b, c = (foo(x) for x in items)
```
