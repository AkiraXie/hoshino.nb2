Derived from the **[flake8-return](../#flake8-return-ret)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for missing explicit `return` statements at the end of functions
that can return non-`None` values.

## Why is this bad?

The lack of an explicit `return` statement at the end of a function that
can return non-`None` values can cause confusion. Python implicitly returns
`None` if no other return value is present. Adding an explicit
`return None` can make the code more readable by clarifying intent.

## Example

```python
def foo(bar):
    if not bar:
        return 1
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(bar):
    if not bar:
        return 1
    return None
```
