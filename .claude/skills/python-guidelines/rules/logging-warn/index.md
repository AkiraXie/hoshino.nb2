Derived from the **[flake8-logging-format](../#flake8-logging-format-g)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `logging.warn` and `logging.Logger.warn`.

## Why is this bad?

`logging.warn` and `logging.Logger.warn` are deprecated in favor of
`logging.warning` and `logging.Logger.warning`, which are functionally
equivalent.

## Known problems

This rule detects uses of the `logging` module via a heuristic.
Specifically, it matches against:

- Uses of the `logging` module itself (e.g., `import logging; logging.info(...)`).
- Uses of `flask.current_app.logger` (e.g., `from flask import current_app; current_app.logger.info(...)`).
- Objects whose name starts with `log` or ends with `logger` or `logging`,
  when used in the same file in which they are defined (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger(); logger.info(...)`).
- Imported objects marked as loggers via the [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects) setting, which can be
  used to enforce these rules against shared logger objects (e.g., `from module import logger; logger.info(...)`,
  when [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects) is set to `["module.logger"]`).

## Example

```python
import logging

logging.warn("Something happened")
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

logging.warning("Something happened")
```

## Options

- [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects)
