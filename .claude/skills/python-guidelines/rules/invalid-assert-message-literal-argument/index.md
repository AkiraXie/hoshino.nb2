## What it does

Checks for invalid use of literals in assert message arguments.

## Why is this bad?

An assert message which is a non-string literal was likely intended
to be used in a comparison assertion, rather than as a message.

## Example

```python
fruits = ["apples", "plums", "pears"]
fruits.filter(lambda fruit: fruit.startwith("p"))
assert len(fruits), 2  # True unless the list is empty
```

Use instead:

```python
fruits = ["apples", "plums", "pears"]
fruits.filter(lambda fruit: fruit.startwith("p"))
assert len(fruits) == 2
```
