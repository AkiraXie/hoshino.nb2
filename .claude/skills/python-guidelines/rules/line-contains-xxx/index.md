## What it does

Checks for "XXX" comments.

## Why is this bad?

"XXX" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved.

Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code, or, at minimum,
using a more descriptive comment tag (e.g, "TODO").

## Example

```python
def speed(distance, time):
    return distance / time  # XXX: Raises ZeroDivisionError for time = 0.
```
