Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for undefined names in `__all__`.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, the `__all__` variable is used to define the names that are
exported when a module is imported as a wildcard (e.g.,
`from foo import *`). The names in `__all__` must be defined in the module,
but are included as strings.

Including an undefined name in `__all__` is likely to raise `NameError` at
runtime, when the module is imported.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will flag undefined names in `__init__.py` file,
even if those names implicitly refer to other modules in the package. Users
that rely on implicit exports should disable this rule in `__init__.py`
files via [`lint.per-file-ignores`](../../settings/#lint_per-file-ignores).

## Example

```python
from foo import bar

__all__ = ["bar", "baz"]  # undefined name `baz` in `__all__`
```

Use instead:

```python
from foo import bar, baz

__all__ = ["bar", "baz"]
```
