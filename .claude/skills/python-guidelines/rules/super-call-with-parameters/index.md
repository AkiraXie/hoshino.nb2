Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `super` calls that pass redundant arguments.

## Why is this bad?

In Python 3, `super` can be invoked without any arguments when: (1) the
first argument is `__class__`, and (2) the second argument is equivalent to
the first argument of the enclosing method.

When possible, omit the arguments to `super` to make the code more concise
and maintainable.

## Example

```python
class A:
    def foo(self):
        pass

class B(A):
    def bar(self):
        super(B, self).foo()
```

Use instead:

```python
class A:
    def foo(self):
        pass

class B(A):
    def bar(self):
        super().foo()
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because removing the arguments from a call
may delete comments that are attached to the arguments.
