Derived from the **[flake8-todos](../#flake8-todos-td)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that a TODO comment is labelled with "TODO".

## Why is this bad?

Ambiguous tags reduce code visibility and can lead to dangling TODOs.
For example, if a comment is tagged with "FIXME" rather than "TODO", it may
be overlooked by future readers.

Note that this rule will only flag "FIXME" and "XXX" tags as incorrect.

## Example

```python
# FIXME(ruff): this should get fixed!
```

Use instead:

```python
# TODO(ruff): this is now fixed!
```
