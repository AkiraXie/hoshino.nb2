Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of comparators other than `<` and `>=` for
`sys.version_info` checks. All other comparators, such
as `>`, `<=`, and `==`, are banned.

## Why is this bad?

Comparing `sys.version_info` with `==` or `<=` has unexpected behavior
and can lead to bugs.

For example, `sys.version_info > (3, 8, 1)` will resolve to `True` if your
Python version is 3.8.1; meanwhile, `sys.version_info <= (3, 8)` will *not*
resolve to `True` if your Python version is 3.8.10:

```python
>>> import sys
>>> print(sys.version_info)
sys.version_info(major=3, minor=8, micro=10, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
>>> print(sys.version_info > (3, 8))
True
>>> print(sys.version_info == (3, 8))
False
>>> print(sys.version_info <= (3, 8))
False
>>> print(sys.version_info in (3, 8))
False
```

## Example

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info > (3, 8): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info >= (3, 9): ...
```
