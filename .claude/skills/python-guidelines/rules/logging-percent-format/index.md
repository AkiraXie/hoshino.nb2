Derived from the **[flake8-logging-format](../#flake8-logging-format-g)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `printf`-style format strings to format logging
messages.

## Why is this bad?

The `logging` module provides a mechanism for passing additional values to
be logged using the `extra` keyword argument. This is more consistent, more
efficient, and less error-prone than formatting the string directly.

Using `printf`-style format strings to format a logging message requires
that Python eagerly format the string, even if the logging statement is
never executed (e.g., if the log level is above the level of the logging
statement), whereas using the `extra` keyword argument defers formatting
until required.

Additionally, the use of `extra` will ensure that the values are made
available to all handlers, which can then be configured to log the values
in a consistent manner.

As an alternative to `extra`, passing values as arguments to the logging
method can also be used to defer string formatting until required.

## Known problems

This rule detects uses of the `logging` module via a heuristic.
Specifically, it matches against:

- Uses of the `logging` module itself (e.g., `import logging; logging.info(...)`).
- Uses of `flask.current_app.logger` (e.g., `from flask import current_app; current_app.logger.info(...)`).
- Objects whose name starts with `log` or ends with `logger` or `logging`,
  when used in the same file in which they are defined (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger(); logger.info(...)`).
- Imported objects marked as loggers via the [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects) setting, which can be
  used to enforce these rules against shared logger objects (e.g., `from module import logger; logger.info(...)`,
  when [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects) is set to `["module.logger"]`).

## Example

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format="%(message)s", level=logging.INFO)

user = "Maria"

logging.info("%s - Something happened" % user)
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format="%(user_id)s - %(message)s", level=logging.INFO)

user = "Maria"

logging.info("Something happened", extra=dict(user_id=user))
```

Or:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format="%(message)s", level=logging.INFO)

user = "Maria"

logging.info("%s - Something happened", user)
```

## Options

- [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects)
