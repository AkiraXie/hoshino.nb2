Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of deprecated methods from the `unittest` module.

## Why is this bad?

The `unittest` module has deprecated aliases for some of its methods.
The deprecated aliases were removed in Python 3.12. Instead of aliases,
use their non-deprecated counterparts.

## Example

```python
from unittest import TestCase

class SomeTest(TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        self.assertEquals(1, 1)
```

Use instead:

```python
from unittest import TestCase

class SomeTest(TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 1)
```
