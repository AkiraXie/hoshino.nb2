Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `yaml.load` function.

## Why is this bad?

Running the `yaml.load` function over untrusted YAML files is insecure, as
`yaml.load` allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects, which can
then be used to execute arbitrary code.

Instead, consider using `yaml.safe_load`, which allows for the creation of
simple Python objects like integers and lists, but prohibits the creation of
more complex objects like functions and classes.

## Example

```python
import yaml

yaml.load(untrusted_yaml)
```

Use instead:

```python
import yaml

yaml.safe_load(untrusted_yaml)
```
