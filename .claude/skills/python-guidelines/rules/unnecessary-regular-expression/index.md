Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `re` module that can be replaced with builtin `str` methods.

## Why is this bad?

Performing checks on strings directly can make the code simpler, may require
less escaping, and will often be faster.

## Example

```python
re.sub("abc", "", s)
```

Use instead:

```python
s.replace("abc", "")
```

## Details

The rule reports the following calls when the first argument to the call is
a plain string literal, and no additional flags are passed:

- `re.sub`
- `re.match`
- `re.search`
- `re.fullmatch`
- `re.split`

For `re.sub`, the `repl` (replacement) argument must also be a string literal,
not a function. For `re.match`, `re.search`, and `re.fullmatch`, the return
value must also be used only for its truth value.

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the affected expression contains comments. Otherwise,
the fix can be applied safely.
