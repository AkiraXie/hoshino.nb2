## What it does

Checks for `if` statements with complex conditionals in stubs.

## Why is this bad?

Type checkers understand simple conditionals to express variations between
different Python versions and platforms. However, complex tests may not be
understood by a type checker, leading to incorrect inferences when they
analyze your code.

## Example

```python
import sys

if (3, 10) <= sys.version_info < (3, 12): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info >= (3, 10) and sys.version_info < (3, 12): ...
```
