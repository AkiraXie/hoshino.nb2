Derived from the **[flake8-quotes](../#flake8-quotes-q)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for strings that include escaped quotes, and suggests changing
the quote style to avoid the need to escape them.

## Why is this bad?

It's preferable to avoid escaped quotes in strings. By changing the
outer quote style, you can avoid escaping inner quotes.

## Example

```python
foo = "bar\"s"
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = 'bar"s'
```

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter). The
formatter automatically removes unnecessary escapes, making the rule
redundant.

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-quotes.inline-quotes`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-quotes_inline-quotes)
