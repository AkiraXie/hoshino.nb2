Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for classes that only have a public `__init__` method,
without base classes and decorators.

## Why is this bad?

Classes with just an `__init__` are possibly better off
being a dataclass or a namedtuple, which have less boilerplate.

## Example

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

Use instead:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float
```
