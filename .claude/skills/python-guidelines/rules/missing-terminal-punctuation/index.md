Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for docstrings in which the first line does not end in a punctuation
mark, such as a period, question mark, or exclamation point.

## Why is this bad?

The first line of a docstring should end with a period, question mark, or
exclamation point, for grammatical correctness and consistency.

This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of
convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the `google`
convention, and disabled when using the `numpy` and `pep257` conventions.

## Example

```python
def average(values: list[float]) -> float:
    """Return the mean of the given values"""
```

Use instead:

```python
def average(values: list[float]) -> float:
    """Return the mean of the given values."""
```
