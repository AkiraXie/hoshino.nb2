Derived from the **[flake8-builtins](../#flake8-builtins-a)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for variable (and function) assignments that use the same names
as builtins.

## Why is this bad?

Reusing a builtin name for the name of a variable increases the
difficulty of reading and maintaining the code, and can cause
non-obvious errors, as readers may mistake the variable for the
builtin and vice versa.

Builtins can be marked as exceptions to this rule via the
[`lint.flake8-builtins.ignorelist`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_ignorelist) configuration option.

## Example

```python
def find_max(list_of_lists):
    max = 0
    for flat_list in list_of_lists:
        for value in flat_list:
            max = max(max, value)  # TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
    return max
```

Use instead:

```python
def find_max(list_of_lists):
    result = 0
    for flat_list in list_of_lists:
        for value in flat_list:
            result = max(result, value)
    return result
```
