## What it does

Checks for hard-coded sequence accesses that are known to be out of bounds.

## Why is this bad?

Attempting to access a sequence with an out-of-bounds index will cause an
`IndexError` to be raised at runtime. When the sequence and index are
defined statically (e.g., subscripts on `list` and `tuple` literals, with
integer indexes), such errors can be detected ahead of time.

## Example

```python
print([0, 1, 2][3])
```
