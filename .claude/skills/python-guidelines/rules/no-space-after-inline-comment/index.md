## What it does

Checks if one space is used after inline comments.

## Why is this bad?

An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.

Per [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments), inline comments should start with a # and a single space.

## Example

```python
x = x + 1  #Increment x
x = x + 1  #  Increment x
x = x + 1  # \xa0Increment x
```

Use instead:

```python
x = x + 1  # Increment x
x = x + 1    # Increment x
```
