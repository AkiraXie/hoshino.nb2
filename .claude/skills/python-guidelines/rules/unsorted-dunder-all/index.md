Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `__all__` definitions that are not ordered
according to an "isort-style" sort.

An isort-style sort orders items first according to their casing:
SCREAMING\_SNAKE\_CASE names (conventionally used for global constants)
come first, followed by CamelCase names (conventionally used for
classes), followed by anything else. Within each category,
a [natural sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order)
is used to order the elements.

## Why is this bad?

Consistency is good. Use a common convention for `__all__` to make your
code more readable and idiomatic.

## Example

```python
import sys

__all__ = [
    "b",
    "c",
    "a",
]

if sys.platform == "win32":
    __all__ += ["z", "y"]
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

__all__ = [
    "a",
    "b",
    "c",
]

if sys.platform == "win32":
    __all__ += ["y", "z"]
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there are any comments that take up
a whole line by themselves inside the `__all__` definition, for example:

```python
__all__ = [
    # eggy things
    "duck_eggs",
    "chicken_eggs",
    # hammy things
    "country_ham",
    "parma_ham",
]
```

This is a common pattern used to delimit categories within a module's API,
but it would be out of the scope of this rule to attempt to maintain these
categories when alphabetically sorting the items of `__all__`.

The fix is also marked as unsafe if there are more than two `__all__` items
on a single line and that line also has a trailing comment, since here it
is impossible to accurately gauge which item the comment should be moved
with when sorting `__all__`:

```python
__all__ = [
    "a", "c", "e",  # a comment
    "b", "d", "f",  # a second  comment
]
```

Other than this, the rule's fix is marked as always being safe, in that
it should very rarely alter the semantics of any Python code.
However, note that (although it's rare) the value of `__all__`
could be read by code elsewhere that depends on the exact
iteration order of the items in `__all__`, in which case this
rule's fix could theoretically cause breakage.
