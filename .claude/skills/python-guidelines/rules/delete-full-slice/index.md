Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for `del` statements that delete the entire slice of a list or
dictionary.

## Why is this bad?

It is faster and more succinct to remove all items via the `clear()`
method.

## Known problems

This rule is prone to false negatives due to type inference limitations,
as it will only detect lists and dictionaries that are instantiated as
literals or annotated with a type annotation.

## Example

```python
names = {"key": "value"}
nums = [1, 2, 3]

del names[:]
del nums[:]
```

Use instead:

```python
names = {"key": "value"}
nums = [1, 2, 3]

names.clear()
nums.clear()
```
