Derived from the **[pandas-vet](../#pandas-vet-pd)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `.iat` on Pandas objects.

## Why is this bad?

The `.iat` method selects a single value from a `DataFrame` or Series based
on an ordinal index, and is slightly faster than using `.iloc`. However,
`.iloc` is more idiomatic and versatile, as it can be used to select
multiple values at once.

If performance is an important consideration, convert the object to a NumPy
array, which will provide a much greater performance boost than using `.iat`
over `.iloc`.

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd

students_df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
students_df.iat[0]
```

Use instead:

```python
import pandas as pd

students_df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
students_df.iloc[0]
```

Or, using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

students_df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
students_df.to_numpy()[0]
```
