Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `open` and `read` that can be replaced by `pathlib`
methods, like `Path.read_text` and `Path.read_bytes`.

## Why is this bad?

When reading the entire contents of a file into a variable, it's simpler
and more concise to use `pathlib` methods like `Path.read_text` and
`Path.read_bytes` instead of `open` and `read` calls via `with` statements.

## Example

```python
with open("file.txt") as f:
    contents = f.read()
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

contents = Path("file.txt").read_text()
```

## Fix Safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression.
