Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `is` and `is not` comparisons against literals, like integers,
strings, or lists.

## Why is this bad?

The `is` and `is not` comparators operate on identity, in that they check
whether two objects are the same object. If the objects are not the same
object, the comparison will always be `False`. Using `is` and `is not` with
constant literals often works "by accident", but are not guaranteed to produce
the expected result.

As of Python 3.8, using `is` and `is not` with constant literals will produce
a `SyntaxWarning`.

This rule will also flag `is` and `is not` comparisons against non-constant
literals, like lists, sets, and dictionaries. While such comparisons will
not raise a `SyntaxWarning`, they are still likely to be incorrect, as they
will compare the identities of the objects instead of their values, which
will always evaluate to `False`.

Instead, use `==` and `!=` to compare literals, which will compare the
values of the objects instead of their identities.

## Example

```python
x = 200
if x is 200:
    print("It's 200!")
```

Use instead:

```python
x = 200
if x == 200:
    print("It's 200!")
```
