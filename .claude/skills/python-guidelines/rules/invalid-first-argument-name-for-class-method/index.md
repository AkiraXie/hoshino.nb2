Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for class methods that use a name other than `cls` for their
first argument.

The method `__new__` is exempted from this
check and the corresponding violation is caught by
[`bad-staticmethod-argument`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/bad-staticmethod-argument/).

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-method-arguments) recommends the use of `cls` as the first argument for all class
methods:

> Always use `cls` for the first argument to class methods.
>
> If a function argument’s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to
> append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption.
> Thus `class_` is better than `clss`. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.)

Names can be excluded from this rule using the [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
or [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names) configuration options. For example,
to allow the use of `klass` as the first argument to class methods, set
the [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names) option to `["klass"]`.

## Example

```python
class Example:
    @classmethod
    def function(self, data): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class Example:
    @classmethod
    def function(cls, data): ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as renaming a method parameter
can change the behavior of the program.
