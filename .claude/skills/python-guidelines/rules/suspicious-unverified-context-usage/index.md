## What it does

Checks for uses of `ssl._create_unverified_context`.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 476](https://peps.python.org/pep-0476/) enabled certificate and hostname validation by default in Python
standard library HTTP clients. Previously, Python did not validate
certificates by default, which could allow an attacker to perform a "man in
the middle" attack by intercepting and modifying traffic between client and
server.

To support legacy environments, `ssl._create_unverified_context` reverts to
the previous behavior that does perform verification. Otherwise, use
`ssl.create_default_context` to create a secure context.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to `ssl._create_unverified_context`.

## Example

```python
import ssl

context = ssl._create_unverified_context()
```

Use instead:

```python
import ssl

context = ssl.create_default_context()
```
