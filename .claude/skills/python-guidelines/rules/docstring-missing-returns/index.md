Derived from the **[pydoclint](../#pydoclint-doc)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for functions with `return` statements that do not have "Returns"
sections in their docstrings.

## Why is this bad?

A missing "Returns" section is a sign of incomplete documentation.

This rule is not enforced for abstract methods or functions that only return
`None`. It is also ignored for "stub functions": functions where the body only
consists of `pass`, `...`, `raise NotImplementedError`, or similar.

## Example

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.
    """
    return distance / time
```

Use instead:

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.
    """
    return distance / time
```
