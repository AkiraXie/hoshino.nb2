Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks if inline comments are separated by at least two spaces.

## Why is this bad?

An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.

Per [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments), inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from
the preceding statement.

## Example

```python
x = x + 1 # Increment x
```

Use instead:

```python
x = x + 1  # Increment x
x = x + 1    # Increment x
```
