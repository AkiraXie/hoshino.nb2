Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary string literal or float casts in `Decimal`
constructors.

## Why is this bad?

The `Decimal` constructor accepts a variety of arguments, including
integers, floats, and strings. However, it's not necessary to cast
integer literals to strings when passing them to the `Decimal`.

Similarly, `Decimal` accepts `inf`, `-inf`, and `nan` as string literals,
so there's no need to wrap those values in a `float` call when passing
them to the `Decimal` constructor.

Prefer the more concise form of argument passing for `Decimal`
constructors, as it's more readable and idiomatic.

Note that this rule does not flag quoted float literals such as `Decimal("0.1")`, which will
produce a more precise `Decimal` value than the unquoted `Decimal(0.1)`.

## Example

```python
from decimal import Decimal

Decimal("0")
Decimal(float("Infinity"))
```

Use instead:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

Decimal(0)
Decimal("Infinity")
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.
