Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `isinstance` that check if an object is of type `None`.

## Why is this bad?

There is only ever one instance of `None`, so it is more efficient and
readable to use the `is` operator to check if an object is `None`.

## Example

```python
isinstance(obj, type(None))
```

Use instead:

```python
obj is None
```

## Fix safety

The fix will be marked as unsafe if there are any comments within the call.
