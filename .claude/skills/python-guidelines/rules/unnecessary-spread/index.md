Derived from the **[flake8-pie](../#flake8-pie-pie)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary dictionary unpacking operators (`**`).

## Why is this bad?

Unpacking a dictionary into another dictionary is redundant. The unpacking
operator can be removed, making the code more readable.

## Example

```python
foo = {"A": 1, "B": 2}
bar = {**foo, **{"C": 3}}
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = {"A": 1, "B": 2}
bar = {**foo, "C": 3}
```
