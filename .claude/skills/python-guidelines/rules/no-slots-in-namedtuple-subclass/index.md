Derived from the **[flake8-slots](../#flake8-slots-slot)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for subclasses of `collections.namedtuple` or `typing.NamedTuple`
that lack a `__slots__` definition.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, the `__slots__` attribute allows you to explicitly define the
attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python
uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory
overhead. However, when `__slots__` is defined, Python uses a more compact
internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory
savings.

Subclasses of `namedtuple` inherit all the attributes and methods of the
built-in `namedtuple` class. Since tuples are typically immutable, they
don't require additional attributes beyond what the `namedtuple` class
provides. Defining `__slots__` for subclasses of `namedtuple` prevents the
creation of a dictionary for each instance, reducing memory consumption.

## Example

```python
from collections import namedtuple

class Foo(namedtuple("foo", ["str", "int"])):
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
from collections import namedtuple

class Foo(namedtuple("foo", ["str", "int"])):
    __slots__ = ()
```
