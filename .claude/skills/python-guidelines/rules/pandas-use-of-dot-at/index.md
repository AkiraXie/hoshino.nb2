Derived from the **[pandas-vet](../#pandas-vet-pd)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `.at` on Pandas objects.

## Why is this bad?

The `.at` method selects a single value from a `DataFrame` or Series based on
a label index, and is slightly faster than using `.loc`. However, `.loc` is
more idiomatic and versatile, as it can be used to select multiple values at
once.

If performance is an important consideration, convert the object to a NumPy
array, which will provide a much greater performance boost than using `.at`
over `.loc`.

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd

students_df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
students_df.at["Maria"]
```

Use instead:

```python
import pandas as pd

students_df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
students_df.loc["Maria"]
```
