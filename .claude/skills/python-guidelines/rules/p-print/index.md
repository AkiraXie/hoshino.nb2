Derived from the **[flake8-print](../#flake8-print-t20)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `pprint` statements.

## Why is this bad?

Like `print` statements, `pprint` statements used for debugging should
be omitted from production code. They can lead the accidental inclusion
of sensitive information in logs, and are not configurable by clients,
unlike `logging` statements.

`pprint` statements used to produce output as a part of a command-line
interface program are not typically a problem.

## Example

```python
import pprint

def merge_dicts(dict_a, dict_b):
    dict_c = {**dict_a, **dict_b}
    pprint.pprint(dict_c)
    return dict_c
```

Use instead:

```python
def merge_dicts(dict_a, dict_b):
    dict_c = {**dict_a, **dict_b}
    return dict_c
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it will remove `pprint` statements
that are used beyond debugging purposes.
