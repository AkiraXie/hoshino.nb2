Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary key checks prior to accessing a dictionary.

## Why is this bad?

When working with dictionaries, the `get` can be used to access a value
without having to check if the dictionary contains the relevant key,
returning `None` if the key is not present.

## Example

```python
if "key" in dct and dct["key"]:
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
if dct.get("key"):
    ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments
or may have side effects.
