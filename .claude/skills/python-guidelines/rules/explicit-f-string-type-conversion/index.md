Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `str()`, `repr()`, and `ascii()` as explicit type
conversions within f-strings.

## Why is this bad?

f-strings support dedicated conversion flags for these types, which are
more succinct and idiomatic.

Note that, in many cases, calling `str()` within an f-string is
unnecessary and can be removed entirely, as the value will be converted
to a string automatically, the notable exception being for classes that
implement a custom `__format__` method.

## Example

```python
a = "some string"
f"{repr(a)}"
```

Use instead:

```python
a = "some string"
f"{a!r}"
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the call expression contains
comments that would be deleted by applying the fix.
