Derived from the **[flake8-executable](../#flake8-executable-exe)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for a shebang directive that is not at the beginning of the file.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a
script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the
script.

The shebang's `#!` prefix must be the first two characters of a file. If
the shebang is not at the beginning of the file, it will be ignored, which
is likely a mistake.

## Example

```python
foo = 1
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

Use instead:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
foo = 1
```
