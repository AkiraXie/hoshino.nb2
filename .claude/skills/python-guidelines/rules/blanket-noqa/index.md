Derived from the **[pygrep-hooks](../#pygrep-hooks-pgh)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Check for `noqa` annotations that suppress all diagnostics, as opposed to
targeting specific diagnostics.

## Why is this bad?

Suppressing all diagnostics can hide issues in the code.

Blanket `noqa` annotations are also more difficult to interpret and
maintain, as the annotation does not clarify which diagnostics are intended
to be suppressed.

## Example

```python
from .base import *  # noqa
```

Use instead:

```python
from .base import *  # noqa: F403
```

## Fix safety

This rule will attempt to fix blanket `noqa` annotations that appear to
be unintentional. For example, given `# noqa F401`, the rule will suggest
inserting a colon, as in `# noqa: F401`.

While modifying `noqa` comments is generally safe, doing so may introduce
additional diagnostics.
