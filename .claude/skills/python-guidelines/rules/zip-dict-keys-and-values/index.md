Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for use of `zip()` to iterate over keys and values of a dictionary at once.

## Why is this bad?

The `dict` type provides an `.items()` method which is faster and more readable.

## Example

```python
flag_stars = {"USA": 50, "Slovenia": 3, "Panama": 2, "Australia": 6}

for country, stars in zip(flag_stars.keys(), flag_stars.values()):
    print(f"{country}'s flag has {stars} stars.")
```

Use instead:

```python
flag_stars = {"USA": 50, "Slovenia": 3, "Panama": 2, "Australia": 6}

for country, stars in flag_stars.items():
    print(f"{country}'s flag has {stars} stars.")
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.
