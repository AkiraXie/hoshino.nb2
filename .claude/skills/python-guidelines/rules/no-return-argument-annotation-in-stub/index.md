Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `typing.NoReturn` (and `typing_extensions.NoReturn`) for
parameter annotations.

## Why is this bad?

Prefer `Never` over `NoReturn` for parameter annotations. `Never` has a
clearer name in these contexts, since it makes little sense to talk about a
parameter annotation "not returning".

This is a purely stylistic lint: the two types have identical semantics for
type checkers. Both represent Python's "[bottom type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type)" (a type that has no
members).

## Example

```python
from typing import NoReturn

def foo(x: NoReturn): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import Never

def foo(x: Never): ...
```
