## What it does

Check for method calls that initiate a subprocess with a shell.

## Why is this bad?

Starting a subprocess with a shell can allow attackers to execute arbitrary
shell commands. Consider starting the process without a shell call and
sanitize the input to mitigate the risk of shell injection.

## Example

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run("ls -l", shell=True)
```

Use instead:

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])
```
