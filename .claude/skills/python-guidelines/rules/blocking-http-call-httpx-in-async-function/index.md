Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that async functions do not use blocking httpx clients.

## Why is this bad?

Blocking an async function via a blocking HTTP call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
HTTP response, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead of using the blocking `httpx` client, use the asynchronous client.

## Example

```python
import httpx

async def fetch():
    client = httpx.Client()
    response = client.get(...)
```

Use instead:

```python
import httpx

async def fetch():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(...)
```
