Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for consistent style regarding whether nonempty tuples in subscripts
are parenthesized.

The exact nature of this violation depends on the setting
[`lint.ruff.parenthesize-tuple-in-subscript`](../../settings/#lint_ruff_parenthesize-tuple-in-subscript). By default, the use of
parentheses is considered a violation.

This rule is not applied inside "typing contexts" (type annotations,
type aliases and subscripted class bases), as these have their own specific
conventions around them.

## Why is this bad?

It is good to be consistent and, depending on the codebase, one or the other
convention may be preferred.

## Example

```python
directions = {(0, 1): "North", (1, 0): "East", (0, -1): "South", (-1, 0): "West"}
directions[(0, 1)]
```

Use instead (with default setting):

```python
directions = {(0, 1): "North", (1, 0): "East", (0, -1): "South", (-1, 0): "West"}
directions[0, 1]
```
