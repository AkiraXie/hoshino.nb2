Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for use of `zip()` to iterate over successive pairs of elements.

## Why is this bad?

When iterating over successive pairs of elements, prefer
`itertools.pairwise()` over `zip()`.

`itertools.pairwise()` is more readable and conveys the intent of the code
more clearly.

## Example

```python
letters = "ABCD"
zip(letters, letters[1:])  # ("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("C", "D")
```

Use instead:

```python
from itertools import pairwise

letters = "ABCD"
pairwise(letters)  # ("A", "B"), ("B", "C"), ("C", "D")
```

## Fix safety

The fix is always marked unsafe because it assumes that slicing an object
(e.g., `obj[1:]`) produces a value with the same type and iteration behavior
as the original object, which is not guaranteed for user-defined types that
override `__getitem__` without properly handling slices. Moreover, the fix
could delete comments.
