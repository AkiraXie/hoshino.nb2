Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary dict, list, and set comprehension.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to use a dict/list/set comprehension to build a data structure if the
elements are unchanged. Wrap the iterable with `dict()`, `list()`, or `set()` instead.

## Example

```python
{a: b for a, b in iterable}
[x for x in iterable]
{x for x in iterable}
```

Use instead:

```python
dict(iterable)
list(iterable)
set(iterable)
```

## Known problems

This rule may produce false positives for dictionary comprehensions that iterate over a mapping.
The dict constructor behaves differently depending on if it receives a sequence (e.g., a
list) or a mapping (e.g., a dict). When a comprehension iterates over the keys of a mapping,
replacing it with a `dict()` constructor call will give a different result.

For example:

```python
>>> d1 = {(1, 2): 3, (4, 5): 6}
>>> {x: y for x, y in d1}  # Iterates over the keys of a mapping
{1: 2, 4: 5}
>>> dict(d1)               # Ruff's incorrect suggested fix
{(1, 2): 3, (4, 5): 6}
>>> dict(d1.keys())        # Correct fix
{1: 2, 4: 5}
```

When the comprehension iterates over a sequence, Ruff's suggested fix is correct. However, Ruff
cannot consistently infer if the iterable type is a sequence or a mapping and cannot suggest
the correct fix for mappings.

## Fix safety

Due to the known problem with dictionary comprehensions, this fix is marked as unsafe.

Additionally, this fix may drop comments when rewriting the comprehension.
