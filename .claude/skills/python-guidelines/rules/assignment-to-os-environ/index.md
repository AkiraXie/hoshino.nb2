Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for assignments to `os.environ`.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, `os.environ` is a mapping that represents the environment of the
current process.

However, reassigning to `os.environ` does not clear the environment. Instead,
it merely updates the `os.environ` for the current process. This can lead to
unexpected behavior, especially when running the program in a subprocess.

Instead, use `os.environ.clear()` to clear the environment, or use the
`env` argument of `subprocess.Popen` to pass a custom environment to
a subprocess.

## Example

```python
import os

os.environ = {"foo": "bar"}
```

Use instead:

```python
import os

os.environ.clear()
os.environ["foo"] = "bar"
```
