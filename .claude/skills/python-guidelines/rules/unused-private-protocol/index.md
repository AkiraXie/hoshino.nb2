## What it does

Checks for the presence of unused private `typing.Protocol` definitions.

## Why is this bad?

A private `typing.Protocol` that is defined but not used is likely a
mistake. It should either be used, made public, or removed to avoid
confusion.

## Example

```python
import typing

class _PrivateProtocol(typing.Protocol):
    foo: int
```

Use instead:

```python
import typing

class _PrivateProtocol(typing.Protocol):
    foo: int

def func(arg: _PrivateProtocol) -> None: ...
```
