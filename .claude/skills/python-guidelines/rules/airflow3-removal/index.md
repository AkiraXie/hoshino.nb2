Derived from the **[Airflow](../#airflow-air)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of deprecated Airflow functions and values.

## Why is this bad?

Airflow 3.0 removed various deprecated functions, members, and other
values. Some have more modern replacements. Others are considered too niche
and not worth continued maintenance in Airflow.

## Example

```python
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

yesterday = days_ago(today, 1)
```

Use instead:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
```
