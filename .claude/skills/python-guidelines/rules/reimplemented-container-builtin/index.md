Derived from the **[flake8-pie](../#flake8-pie-pie)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for lambdas that can be replaced with the `list` or `dict` builtins.

## Why is this bad?

Using container builtins are more succinct and idiomatic than wrapping
the literal in a lambda.

## Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Foo:
    bar: list[int] = field(default_factory=lambda: [])
```

Use instead:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Foo:
    bar: list[int] = field(default_factory=list)
    baz: dict[str, int] = field(default_factory=dict)
```
