Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for unused variables in loops (e.g., `for` and `while` statements).

## Why is this bad?

Defining a variable in a loop statement that is never used can confuse
readers.

If the variable is intended to be unused (e.g., to facilitate
destructuring of a tuple or other object), prefix it with an underscore
to indicate the intent. Otherwise, remove the variable entirely.

## Example

```python
for i, j in foo:
    bar(i)
```

Use instead:

```python
for i, _j in foo:
    bar(i)
```
