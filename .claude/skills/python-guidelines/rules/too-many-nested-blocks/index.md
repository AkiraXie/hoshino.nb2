Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for functions or methods with too many nested blocks.

By default, this rule allows up to five nested blocks.
This can be configured using the [`lint.pylint.max-nested-blocks`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_max-nested-blocks) option.

## Why is this bad?

Functions or methods with too many nested blocks are harder to understand
and maintain.

## Options

- [`lint.pylint.max-nested-blocks`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_max-nested-blocks)
