## What it does

Checks for `continue` statements inside `finally`

## Why is this bad?

`continue` statements were not allowed within `finally` clauses prior to
Python 3.8. Using a `continue` statement within a `finally` clause can
cause a `SyntaxError`.

## Example

```python
while True:
    try:
        pass
    finally:
        continue
```

Use instead:

```python
while True:
    try:
        pass
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        continue
```

## Options
