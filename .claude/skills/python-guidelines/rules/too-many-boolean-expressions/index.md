Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for too many Boolean expressions in an `if` statement.

By default, this rule allows up to 5 expressions. This can be configured
using the [`lint.pylint.max-bool-expr`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_max-bool-expr) option.

## Why is this bad?

`if` statements with many Boolean expressions are harder to understand
and maintain. Consider assigning the result of the Boolean expression,
or any of its sub-expressions, to a variable.

## Example

```python
if a and b and c and d and e and f and g and h:
    ...
```

## Options

- [`lint.pylint.max-bool-expr`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_max-bool-expr)
