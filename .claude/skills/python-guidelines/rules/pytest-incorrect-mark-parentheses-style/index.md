Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for argument-free `@pytest.mark.<marker>()` decorators with or
without parentheses, depending on the [`lint.flake8-pytest-style.mark-parentheses`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-pytest-style_mark-parentheses)
setting.

The rule defaults to removing unnecessary parentheses,
to match the documentation of the official pytest projects.

## Why is this bad?

If a `@pytest.mark.<marker>()` doesn't take any arguments, the parentheses are
optional.

Either removing those unnecessary parentheses *or* requiring them for all
fixtures is fine, but it's best to be consistent.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.foo()
def test_something(): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.foo
def test_something(): ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there's comments in the
`pytest.mark.<marker>` decorator.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.foo(
    # comment
)
def test_something(): ...
```
