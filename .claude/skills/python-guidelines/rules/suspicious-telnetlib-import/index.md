This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for imports of the `telnetlib` module.

## Why is this bad?

Telnet is considered insecure. It is deprecated since version 3.11, and
was removed in version 3.13. Instead, use SSH or another encrypted
protocol.

## Example

```python
import telnetlib
```
