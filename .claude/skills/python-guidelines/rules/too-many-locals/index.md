Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for functions that include too many local variables.

By default, this rule allows up to fifteen locals, as configured by the
[`lint.pylint.max-locals`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_max-locals) option.

## Why is this bad?

Functions with many local variables are harder to understand and maintain.

Consider refactoring functions with many local variables into smaller
functions with fewer assignments.

## Options

- [`lint.pylint.max-locals`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_max-locals)
