Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of assertion methods from the `unittest` module.

## Why is this bad?

To make use of `pytest`'s assertion rewriting, a regular `assert` statement
is preferred over `unittest`'s assertion methods.

## Example

```python
import unittest

class TestFoo(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_foo(self):
        self.assertEqual(a, b)
```

Use instead:

```python
import unittest

class TestFoo(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_foo(self):
        assert a == b
```
