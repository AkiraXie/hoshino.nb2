## What it does

Checks for indexed access to lists, strings, tuples, bytes, and comprehensions
using a type other than an integer or slice.

## Why is this bad?

Only integers or slices can be used as indices to these types. Using
other types will result in a `TypeError` at runtime and a `SyntaxWarning` at
import time.

## Example

```python
var = [1, 2, 3]["x"]
```

Use instead:

```python
var = [1, 2, 3][0]
```
