Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.raises` calls without an expected exception.

## Why is this bad?

`pytest.raises` expects to receive an expected exception as its first
argument. If omitted, the `pytest.raises` call will fail at runtime.
The rule will also accept calls without an expected exception but with
`match` and/or `check` keyword arguments, which are also valid after
pytest version 8.4.0.

## Example

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    with pytest.raises():
        do_something()
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    with pytest.raises(SomeException):
        do_something()
```
