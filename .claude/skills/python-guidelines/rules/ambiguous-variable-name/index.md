Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of the characters 'l', 'O', or 'I' as variable names.

Note: This rule is automatically disabled for all stub files
(files with `.pyi` extensions). The rule has little relevance for authors
of stubs: a well-written stub should aim to faithfully represent the
interface of the equivalent .py file as it exists at runtime, including any
ambiguously named variables in the runtime module.

## Why is this bad?

In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the
numerals one and zero. When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead.

## Example

```python
l = 0
O = 123
I = 42
```

Use instead:

```python
L = 0
o = 123
i = 42
```
