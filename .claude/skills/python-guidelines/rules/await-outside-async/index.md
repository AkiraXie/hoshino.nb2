Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `await` outside `async` functions.

## Why is this bad?

Using `await` outside an `async` function is a syntax error.

## Example

```python
import asyncio

def foo():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

Use instead:

```python
import asyncio

async def foo():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

## Notebook behavior

As an exception, `await` is allowed at the top level of a Jupyter notebook
(see: [autoawait](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/autoawait.html)).
