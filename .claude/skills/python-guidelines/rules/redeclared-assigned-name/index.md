Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for declared assignments to the same variable multiple times
in the same assignment.

## Why is this bad?

Assigning a variable multiple times in the same assignment is redundant,
as the final assignment to the variable is what the value will be.

## Example

```python
a, b, a = (1, 2, 3)
print(a)  # 3
```

Use instead:

```python
# this is assuming you want to assign 3 to `a`
_, b, a = (1, 2, 3)
print(a)  # 3
```

## Options

The rule ignores assignments to dummy variables, as specified by:

- [`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx)
