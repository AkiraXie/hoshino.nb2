Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `except` clauses that attempt to catch multiple
exceptions with a binary operation (`and` or `or`).

## Why is this bad?

A binary operation will not catch multiple exceptions. Instead, the binary
operation will be evaluated first, and the result of *that* operation will
be caught (for an `or` operation, this is typically the first exception in
the list). This is almost never the desired behavior.

## Example

```python
try:
    pass
except A or B:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
try:
    pass
except (A, B):
    pass
```
