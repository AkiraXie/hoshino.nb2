## What it does

Checks for uses of cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generators.

## Why is this bad?

Cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generators are insecure, as they
are easily predictable. This can allow an attacker to guess the generated
numbers and compromise the security of the system.

Instead, use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator
(such as using the [`secrets` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html))
when generating random numbers for security purposes.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to these generators.

## Example

```python
import random

random.randrange(10)
```

Use instead:

```python
import secrets

secrets.randbelow(10)
```
