Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `round()` calls that have no effect on the input.

## Why is this bad?

Rounding a value that's already an integer is unnecessary.
It's clearer to use the value directly.

## Example

```python
a = round(1, 0)
```

Use instead:

```python
a = 1
```

## Fix safety

The fix is marked unsafe if it is not possible to guarantee that the first argument of
`round()` is of type `int`, or if the fix deletes comments.
