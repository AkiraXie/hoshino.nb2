Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of non-ASCII characters in import statements.

## Why is this bad?

The use of non-ASCII characters in import statements can cause confusion
and compatibility issues (see: [PEP 672](https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/)).

## Example

```python
import bár
```

Use instead:

```python
import bar
```

If the module is third-party, use an ASCII-only alias:

```python
import bár as bar
```
