Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary nested `Literal`.

## Why is this bad?

Prefer using a single `Literal`, which is equivalent and more concise.

Parameterization of literals by other literals is supported as an ergonomic
feature as proposed in [PEP 586](https://peps.python.org/pep-0586/), to enable patterns such as:

```python
ReadOnlyMode         = Literal["r", "r+"]
WriteAndTruncateMode = Literal["w", "w+", "wt", "w+t"]
WriteNoTruncateMode  = Literal["r+", "r+t"]
AppendMode           = Literal["a", "a+", "at", "a+t"]

AllModes = Literal[ReadOnlyMode, WriteAndTruncateMode,
                  WriteNoTruncateMode, AppendMode]
```

As a consequence, type checkers also support nesting of literals
which is less readable than a flat `Literal`:

```python
AllModes = Literal[Literal["r", "r+"], Literal["w", "w+", "wt", "w+t"],
                  Literal["r+", "r+t"], Literal["a", "a+", "at", "a+t"]]
```

## Example

```python
AllModes = Literal[
    Literal["r", "r+"],
    Literal["w", "w+", "wt", "w+t"],
    Literal["r+", "r+t"],
    Literal["a", "a+", "at", "a+t"],
]
```

Use instead:

```python
AllModes = Literal[
    "r", "r+", "w", "w+", "wt", "w+t", "r+", "r+t", "a", "a+", "at", "a+t"
]
```

or assign the literal to a variable as in the first example.

## Fix safety

The fix for this rule is marked as unsafe when the `Literal` slice is split
across multiple lines and some of the lines have trailing comments.
