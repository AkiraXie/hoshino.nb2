Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for docstring summary lines that are not positioned on the first
physical line of the docstring.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257) recommends that multi-line docstrings consist of "a summary line
just like a one-line docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a
more elaborate description."

The summary line should be located on the first physical line of the
docstring, immediately after the opening quotes.

This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of
convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the `google`
convention, and disabled when using the `numpy` and `pep257` conventions.

For an alternative, see [D213](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/multi-line-summary-second-line).

## Example

```python
def sort_list(l: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """
    Return a sorted copy of the list.

    Sort the list in ascending order and return a copy of the result using the
    bubble sort algorithm.
    """
```

Use instead:

```python
def sort_list(l: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Return a sorted copy of the list.

    Sort the list in ascending order and return a copy of the result using the bubble
    sort algorithm.
    """
```
