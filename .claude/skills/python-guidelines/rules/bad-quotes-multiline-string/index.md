Derived from the **[flake8-quotes](../#flake8-quotes-q)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for multiline strings that use single quotes or double quotes,
depending on the value of the [`lint.flake8-quotes.multiline-quotes`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-quotes_multiline-quotes)
setting.

## Why is this bad?

Consistency is good. Use either single or double quotes for multiline
strings, but be consistent.

## Example

```python
foo = '''
bar
'''
```

Assuming `multiline-quotes` is set to `double`, use instead:

```python
foo = """
bar
"""
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-quotes.multiline-quotes`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-quotes_multiline-quotes)

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter). The
formatter enforces double quotes for multiline strings, making the rule
redundant.
