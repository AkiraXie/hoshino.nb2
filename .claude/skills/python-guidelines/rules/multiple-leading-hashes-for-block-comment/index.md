Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for block comments that start with multiple leading `#` characters.

## Why is this bad?

Per [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments), "Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built
out of complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period."

Each line of a block comment should start with a `#` followed by a single space.

Shebangs (lines starting with `#!`, at the top of a file) are exempt from this
rule.

## Example

```python
### Block comment
```

Use instead:

```python
# Block comment
```

Alternatively, this rule makes an exception for comments that consist
solely of `#` characters, as in:

```python
##############
# Block header
##############
```
