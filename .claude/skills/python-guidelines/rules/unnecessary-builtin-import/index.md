Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary imports of builtins.

## Why is this bad?

Builtins are always available. Importing them is unnecessary and should be
removed to avoid confusion.

## Example

```python
from builtins import str

str(1)
```

Use instead:

```python
str(1)
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked as unsafe because it will remove comments attached to the unused import.

## Options

This rule will not trigger on imports required by the `isort` configuration.

- [`lint.isort.required-imports`](../../settings/#lint_isort_required-imports)
