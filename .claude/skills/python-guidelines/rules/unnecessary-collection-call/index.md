Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `dict()`, `list()` or `tuple()` calls that can be
rewritten as empty literals.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to call, e.g., `dict()` as opposed to using an empty
literal (`{}`). The former is slower because the name `dict` must be
looked up in the global scope in case it has been rebound.

## Example

```python
dict()
dict(a=1, b=2)
list()
tuple()
```

Use instead:

```python
{}
{"a": 1, "b": 2}
[]
()
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
