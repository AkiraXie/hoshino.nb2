Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of unnecessary quotes in type annotations.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, type annotations can be quoted to avoid forward references.

However, if `from __future__ import annotations` is present, Python
will always evaluate type annotations in a deferred manner, making
the quotes unnecessary.

Similarly, if the annotation is located in a typing-only context and
won't be evaluated by Python at runtime, the quotes will also be
considered unnecessary. For example, Python does not evaluate type
annotations on assignments in function bodies.

## Example

Given:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

def foo(bar: "Bar") -> "Bar": ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

def foo(bar: Bar) -> Bar: ...
```

Given:

```python
def foo() -> None:
    bar: "Bar"
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo() -> None:
    bar: Bar
```

## Preview

When [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/) is enabled, if [`lint.future-annotations`](../../settings/#lint_future-annotations) is set to `true`,
`from __future__ import annotations` will be added if doing so would allow an annotation to be
unquoted.

## Fix safety

The rule's fix is marked as safe, unless [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/) and
[`lint.future-annotations`](../../settings/#lint_future-annotations) are enabled and a `from __future__ import annotations` import is added. Such an import may change the behavior of all annotations in the
file.

## Options

- [`lint.future-annotations`](../../settings/#lint_future-annotations)
