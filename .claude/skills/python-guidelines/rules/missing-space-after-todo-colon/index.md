Derived from the **[flake8-todos](../#flake8-todos-td)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that the colon after a "TODO" tag is followed by a space.

## Why is this bad?

"TODO" tags are typically followed by a parenthesized author name, a colon,
a space, and a description of the issue, in that order.

Deviating from this pattern can lead to inconsistent and non-idiomatic
comments.

## Example

```python
# TODO(charlie):fix this
```

Use instead:

```python
# TODO(charlie): fix this
```
