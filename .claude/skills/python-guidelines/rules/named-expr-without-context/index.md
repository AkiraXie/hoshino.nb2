Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of named expressions (e.g., `a := 42`) that can be
replaced by regular assignment statements (e.g., `a = 42`).

## Why is this bad?

While a top-level named expression is syntactically and semantically valid,
it's less clear than a regular assignment statement. Named expressions are
intended to be used in comprehensions and generator expressions, where
assignment statements are not allowed.

## Example

```python
(a := 42)
```

Use instead:

```python
a = 42
```
