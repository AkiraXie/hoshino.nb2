Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `functools.lru_cache` and `functools.cache`
decorators on methods.

## Why is this bad?

Using the `functools.lru_cache` and `functools.cache` decorators on methods
can lead to memory leaks, as the global cache will retain a reference to
the instance, preventing it from being garbage collected.

Instead, refactor the method to depend only on its arguments and not on the
instance of the class, or use the `@lru_cache` decorator on a function
outside of the class.

This rule ignores instance methods on enumeration classes, as enum members
are singletons.

## Example

```python
from functools import lru_cache

def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x * x

class Number:
    value: int

    @lru_cache
    def squared(self):
        return square(self.value)
```

Use instead:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache
def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x * x

class Number:
    value: int

    def squared(self):
        return square(self.value)
```

## Options

This rule only applies to regular methods, not static or class methods. You can customize how
Ruff categorizes methods with the following options:

- [`lint.pep8-naming.classmethod-decorators`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_classmethod-decorators)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.staticmethod-decorators`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_staticmethod-decorators)
