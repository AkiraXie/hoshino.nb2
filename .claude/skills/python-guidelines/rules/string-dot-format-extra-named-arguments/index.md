Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `str.format` calls with unused keyword arguments.

## Why is this bad?

Unused keyword arguments are redundant, and often indicative of a mistake.
They should be removed.

## Example

```python
"Hello, {name}".format(greeting="Hello", name="World")
```

Use instead:

```python
"Hello, {name}".format(name="World")
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the unused keyword argument
contains a function call with potential side effects,
because removing such arguments could change the behavior of the code.

For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case:

```python
"Hello, {name}".format(greeting=print(1), name="World")
```
