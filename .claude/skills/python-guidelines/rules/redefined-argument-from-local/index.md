Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for variables defined in `for`, `try`, `with` statements
that redefine function parameters.

## Why is this bad?

Redefined variables can cause unexpected behavior because of overridden function parameters.
If nested functions are declared, an inner function's body can override an outer function's parameters.

## Example

```python
def show(host_id=10.11):
    for host_id, host in [[12.13, "Venus"], [14.15, "Mars"]]:
        print(host_id, host)
```

Use instead:

```python
def show(host_id=10.11):
    for inner_host_id, host in [[12.13, "Venus"], [14.15, "Mars"]]:
        print(host_id, inner_host_id, host)
```
