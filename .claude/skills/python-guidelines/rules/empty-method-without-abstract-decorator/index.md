## What it does

Checks for empty methods in abstract base classes without an abstract
decorator.

## Why is this bad?

Empty methods in abstract base classes without an abstract decorator may be
be indicative of a mistake. If the method is meant to be abstract, add an
`@abstractmethod` decorator to the method.

## Example

```python
from abc import ABC

class Foo(ABC):
    def method(self): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Foo(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def method(self): ...
```
