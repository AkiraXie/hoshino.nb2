Derived from the **[flake8-executable](../#flake8-executable-exe)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for whitespace before a shebang directive.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a
script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the
script.

The shebang's `#!` prefix must be the first two characters of a file. The
presence of whitespace before the shebang will cause the shebang to be
ignored, which is likely a mistake.

## Example

```python
 #!/usr/bin/env python3
```

Use instead:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```
