Derived from the **[flake8-logging](../#flake8-logging-log)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for any usage of `__cached__` and `__file__` as an argument to
`logging.getLogger()`.

## Why is this bad?

The [logging documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logger-objects) recommends this pattern:

```python
logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Here, `__name__` is the fully qualified module name, such as `foo.bar`,
which is the intended format for logger names.

This rule detects probably-mistaken usage of similar module-level dunder constants:

- `__cached__` - the pathname of the module's compiled version, such as `foo/__pycache__/bar.cpython-311.pyc`.
- `__file__` - the pathname of the module, such as `foo/bar.py`.

## Example

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__file__)
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

## Fix safety

This fix is always unsafe, as changing the arguments to `getLogger` can change the
received logger object, and thus program behavior.
