Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `open()` builtin.

## Why is this bad?

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation. When possible,
using `Path` object methods such as `Path.open()` can improve readability
over the `open` builtin.

## Examples

```python
with open("f1.py", "wb") as fp:
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

with Path("f1.py").open("wb") as fp:
    ...
```

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than working directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.

## Fix Safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression.
