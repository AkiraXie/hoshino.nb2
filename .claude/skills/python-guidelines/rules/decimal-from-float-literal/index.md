Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `Decimal` calls passing a float literal.

## Why is this bad?

Float literals have limited precision that can lead to unexpected results.
The `Decimal` class is designed to handle numbers with fixed-point precision,
so a string literal should be used instead.

## Example

```python
num = Decimal(1.2345)
```

Use instead:

```python
num = Decimal("1.2345")
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because it changes the underlying value
of the `Decimal` instance that is constructed. This can lead to unexpected
behavior if your program relies on the previous value (whether deliberately or not).
