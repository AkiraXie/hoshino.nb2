Derived from the **[tryceratops](../#tryceratops-try)** linter.

**Warning: This rule has been removed and its documentation is only available for historical reasons.**

## Removed

This rule is identical to [B904](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/raise-without-from-inside-except/) which should be used instead.

## What it does

Checks for exceptions that are re-raised without specifying the cause via
the `from` keyword.

## Why is this bad?

The `from` keyword sets the `__cause__` attribute of the exception, which
stores the "cause" of the exception. The availability of an exception
"cause" is useful for debugging.

## Example

```python
def reciprocal(n):
    try:
        return 1 / n
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        raise ValueError()
```

Use instead:

```python
def reciprocal(n):
    try:
        return 1 / n
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise ValueError() from exc
```
