This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for implicit class variables in dataclasses.

Variables matching the [`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx) are excluded
from this rule.

## Why is this bad?

Class variables are shared between all instances of that class.
In dataclasses, fields with no annotations at all
are implicitly considered class variables, and a `TypeError` is
raised if a user attempts to initialize an instance of the class
with this field.

```python
@dataclass
class C:
    a = 1
    b: str = ""

C(a = 42)  # TypeError: C.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'a'
```

## Example

```python
@dataclass
class C:
    a = 1
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import ClassVar

@dataclass
class C:
    a: ClassVar[int] = 1
```

## Options

- [`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx)
