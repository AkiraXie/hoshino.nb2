Derived from the **[pygrep-hooks](../#pygrep-hooks-pgh)** linter.

## What it does

Check for `type: ignore` annotations that suppress all type warnings, as
opposed to targeting specific type warnings.

## Why is this bad?

Suppressing all warnings can hide issues in the code.

Blanket `type: ignore` annotations are also more difficult to interpret and
maintain, as the annotation does not clarify which warnings are intended
to be suppressed.

## Example

```python
from foo import secrets  # type: ignore
```

Use instead:

```python
from foo import secrets  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
```

## References

Mypy supports a [built-in setting](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_code_list2.html#check-that-type-ignore-include-an-error-code-ignore-without-code)
to enforce that all `type: ignore` annotations include an error code, akin
to enabling this rule:

```python
[tool.mypy]
enable_error_code = ["ignore-without-code"]
```
