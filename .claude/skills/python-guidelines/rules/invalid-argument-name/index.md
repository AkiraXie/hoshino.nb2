Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for argument names that do not follow the `snake_case` convention.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-method-arguments) recommends that function names should be lower case and separated
by underscores (also known as `snake_case`).

> Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores
> as necessary to improve readability.
>
> Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
>
> mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the
> prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

Methods decorated with [`@typing.override`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override) are ignored.

## Example

```python
def my_function(A, myArg):
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
def my_function(a, my_arg):
    pass
```
