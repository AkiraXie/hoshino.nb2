Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for index-based list accesses during `enumerate` iterations.

## Why is this bad?

When iterating over a list with `enumerate`, the current item is already
available alongside its index. Using the index to look up the item is
unnecessary.

## Example

```python
letters = ["a", "b", "c"]

for index, letter in enumerate(letters):
    print(letters[index])
```

Use instead:

```python
letters = ["a", "b", "c"]

for index, letter in enumerate(letters):
    print(letter)
```
