## What it does

Checks for "FIXME" comments.

## Why is this bad?

"FIXME" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved
(usually, a bug or unexpected behavior).

Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code.

Note that if you use "FIXME" comments as a form of documentation, this
rule may not be appropriate for your project.

## Example

```python
def speed(distance, time):
    return distance / time  # FIXME: Raises ZeroDivisionError for time = 0.
```
