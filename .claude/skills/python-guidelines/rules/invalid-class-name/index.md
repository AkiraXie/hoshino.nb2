Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for class names that do not follow the `CamelCase` convention.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#class-names) recommends the use of the `CapWords` (or `CamelCase`) convention
for class names:

> Class names should normally use the `CapWords` convention.
>
> The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where the interface is
> documented and used primarily as a callable.
>
> Note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin names are single
> words (or two words run together), with the `CapWords` convention used only for exception
> names and builtin constants.

## Example

```python
class my_class:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
class MyClass:
    pass
```
