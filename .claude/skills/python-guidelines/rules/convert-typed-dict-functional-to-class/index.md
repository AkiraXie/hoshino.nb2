Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `TypedDict` declarations that use functional syntax.

## Why is this bad?

`TypedDict` types can be defined either through a functional syntax
(`Foo = TypedDict(...)`) or a class syntax (`class Foo(TypedDict): ...`).

The class syntax is more readable and generally preferred over the
functional syntax.

Nonetheless, there are some situations in which it is impossible to use
the class-based syntax. This rule will not apply to those cases. Namely,
it is impossible to use the class-based syntax if any `TypedDict` fields are:

- Not valid [python identifiers](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers) (for example, `@x`)
- [Python keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) such as `in`
- [Private names](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables) such as `__id` that would undergo [name mangling](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#private-name-mangling) at runtime
  if the class-based syntax was used
- [Dunder names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#reserved-classes-of-identifiers) such as `__int__` that can confuse type checkers if they're used
  with the class-based syntax.

## Example

```python
from typing import TypedDict

Foo = TypedDict("Foo", {"a": int, "b": str})
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class Foo(TypedDict):
    a: int
    b: str
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there are any comments within the
range of the `TypedDict` definition, as these will be dropped by the
autofix.
