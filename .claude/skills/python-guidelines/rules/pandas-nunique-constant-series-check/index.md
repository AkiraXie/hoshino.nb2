## What it does

Check for uses of `.nunique()` to check if a Pandas Series is constant
(i.e., contains only one unique value).

## Why is this bad?

`.nunique()` is computationally inefficient for checking if a Series is
constant.

Consider, for example, a Series of length `n` that consists of increasing
integer values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). The `.nunique()` method will iterate
over the entire Series to count the number of unique values. But in this
case, we can detect that the Series is non-constant after visiting the
first two values, which are non-equal.

In general, `.nunique()` requires iterating over the entire Series, while a
more efficient approach allows short-circuiting the operation as soon as a
non-equal value is found.

Instead of calling `.nunique()`, convert the Series to a NumPy array, and
check if all values in the array are equal to the first observed value.

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series(range(1000))
if data.nunique() <= 1:
    print("Series is constant")
```

Use instead:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series(range(1000))
array = data.to_numpy()
if array.shape[0] == 0 or (array[0] == array).all():
    print("Series is constant")
```
