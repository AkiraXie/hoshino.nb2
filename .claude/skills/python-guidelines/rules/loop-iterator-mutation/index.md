This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for mutations to an iterable during a loop iteration.

## Why is this bad?

When iterating over an iterable, mutating the iterable can lead to unexpected
behavior, like skipping elements or infinite loops.

## Example

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]

for item in items:
    print(item)

    # Create an infinite loop by appending to the list.
    items.append(item)
```
