Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for functions that end with an unnecessary `return` or
`return None`, and contain no other `return` statements.

## Why is this bad?

Python implicitly assumes a `None` return at the end of a function, making
it unnecessary to explicitly write `return None`.

## Example

```python
def f():
    print(5)
    return None
```

Use instead:

```python
def f():
    print(5)
```
