Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `os.rmdir`.

## Why is this bad?

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to
the lower-level API offered by `os`. When possible, using `Path` object
methods such as `Path.rmdir()` can improve readability over the `os`
module's counterparts (e.g., `os.rmdir()`).

## Examples

```python
import os

os.rmdir("folder/")
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

Path("folder/").rmdir()
```

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.

## Fix Safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression.
