Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for type aliases that do not use the CamelCase naming convention.

## Why is this bad?

It's conventional to use the CamelCase naming convention for type aliases,
to distinguish them from other variables.

## Example

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

type_alias_name: TypeAlias = int
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

TypeAliasName: TypeAlias = int
```
