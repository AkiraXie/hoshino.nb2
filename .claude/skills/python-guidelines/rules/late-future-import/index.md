Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `__future__` imports that are not located at the beginning of a
file.

## Why is this bad?

Imports from `__future__` must be placed the beginning of the file, before any
other statements (apart from docstrings). The use of `__future__` imports
elsewhere is invalid and will result in a `SyntaxError`.

## Example

```python
from pathlib import Path

from __future__ import annotations
```

Use instead:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from pathlib import Path
```
