Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for docstrings on class definitions that are preceded by a blank
line.

## Why is this bad?

Avoid introducing any blank lines between a class definition and its
docstring, for consistency.

This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of
convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the `google`,
`numpy`, and `pep257` conventions.

For an alternative, see [D203](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/incorrect-blank-line-before-class).

## Example

```python
class PhotoMetadata:

    """Metadata about a photo."""
```

Use instead:

```python
class PhotoMetadata:
    """Metadata about a photo."""
```

## Options
