Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for incorrect function signatures on `__exit__` and `__aexit__`
methods.

## Why is this bad?

Improperly annotated `__exit__` and `__aexit__` methods can cause
unexpected behavior when interacting with type checkers.

## Example

```python
from types import TracebackType

class Foo:
    def __exit__(
        self, typ: BaseException, exc: BaseException, tb: TracebackType
    ) -> None: ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from types import TracebackType

class Foo:
    def __exit__(
        self,
        typ: type[BaseException] | None,
        exc: BaseException | None,
        tb: TracebackType | None,
    ) -> None: ...
```
