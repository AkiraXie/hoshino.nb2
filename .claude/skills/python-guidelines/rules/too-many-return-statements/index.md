Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for functions or methods with too many return statements.

By default, this rule allows up to six return statements, as configured by
the [`lint.pylint.max-returns`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_max-returns) option.

## Why is this bad?

Functions or methods with many return statements are harder to understand
and maintain, and often indicative of complex logic.

## Example

```python
def capital(country: str) -> str | None:
    if country == "England":
        return "London"
    elif country == "France":
        return "Paris"
    elif country == "Poland":
        return "Warsaw"
    elif country == "Romania":
        return "Bucharest"
    elif country == "Spain":
        return "Madrid"
    elif country == "Thailand":
        return "Bangkok"
    else:
        return None
```

Use instead:

```python
def capital(country: str) -> str | None:
    capitals = {
        "England": "London",
        "France": "Paris",
        "Poland": "Warsaw",
        "Romania": "Bucharest",
        "Spain": "Madrid",
        "Thailand": "Bangkok",
    }
    return capitals.get(country)
```
