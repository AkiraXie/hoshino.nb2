Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for lock objects that are created and immediately discarded in
`with` statements.

## Why is this bad?

Creating a lock (via `threading.Lock` or similar) in a `with` statement
has no effect, as locks are only relevant when shared between threads.

Instead, assign the lock to a variable outside the `with` statement,
and share that variable between threads.

## Example

```python
import threading

counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter

    with threading.Lock():
        counter += 1
```

Use instead:

```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    global counter

    with lock:
        counter += 1
```
