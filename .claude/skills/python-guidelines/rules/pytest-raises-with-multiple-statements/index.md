Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.raises` context managers with multiple statements.

This rule allows `pytest.raises` bodies to contain `for`
loops with empty bodies (e.g., `pass` or `...` statements), to test
iterator behavior.

## Why is this bad?

When a `pytest.raises` is used as a context manager and contains multiple
statements, it can lead to the test passing when it actually should fail.

A `pytest.raises` context manager should only contain a single simple
statement that raises the expected exception.

## Example

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    with pytest.raises(MyError):
        setup()
        func_to_test()  # not executed if `setup()` raises `MyError`
        assert foo()  # not executed
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    setup()
    with pytest.raises(MyError):
        func_to_test()
    assert foo()
```
