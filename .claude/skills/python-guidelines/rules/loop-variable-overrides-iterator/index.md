Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for loop control variables that override the loop iterable.

## Why is this bad?

Loop control variables should not override the loop iterable, as this can
lead to confusing behavior.

Instead, use a distinct variable name for any loop control variables.

## Example

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]

for items in items:
    print(items)
```

Use instead:

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]

for item in items:
    print(item)
```
