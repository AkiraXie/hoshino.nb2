Derived from the **[flake8-annotations](../#flake8-annotations-ann)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that function arguments are annotated with a more specific type than
`Any`.

## Why is this bad?

`Any` is a special type indicating an unconstrained type. When an
expression is annotated with type `Any`, type checkers will allow all
operations on it.

It's better to be explicit about the type of an expression, and to use
`Any` as an "escape hatch" only when it is really needed.

## Example

```python
from typing import Any

def foo(x: Any): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(x: int): ...
```

## Known problems

Type aliases are unsupported and can lead to false positives.
For example, the following will trigger this rule inadvertently:

```python
from typing import Any

MyAny = Any

def foo(x: MyAny): ...
```
