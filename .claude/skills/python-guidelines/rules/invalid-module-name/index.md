Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for module names that do not follow the `snake_case` naming
convention or are otherwise invalid.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names) recommends the use of the `snake_case` naming convention for
module names:

> Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the
> module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short,
> all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.
>
> When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that
> provides a higher level (e.g. more object-oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has
> a leading underscore (e.g. `_socket`).

Further, in order for Python modules to be importable, they must be valid
identifiers. As such, they cannot start with a digit, or collide with hard
keywords, like `import` or `class`.

## Example

- Instead of `example-module-name` or `example module name`, use `example_module_name`.
- Instead of `ExampleModule`, use `example_module`.

## Options

- [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
