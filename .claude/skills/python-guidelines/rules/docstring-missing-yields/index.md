Derived from the **[pydoclint](../#pydoclint-doc)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for functions with `yield` statements that do not have "Yields" sections in
their docstrings.

## Why is this bad?

A missing "Yields" section is a sign of incomplete documentation.

This rule is not enforced for abstract methods or functions that only yield `None`.
It is also ignored for "stub functions": functions where the body only consists
of `pass`, `...`, `raise NotImplementedError`, or similar.

## Example

```python
def count_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """Generate integers up to *n*.

    Args:
        n: The number at which to stop counting.
    """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        yield i
```

Use instead:

```python
def count_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """Generate integers up to *n*.

    Args:
        n: The number at which to stop counting.

    Yields:
        int: The number we're at in the count.
    """
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        yield i
```
