Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for imports of the `xml.etree.cElementTree` and `xml.etree.ElementTree` modules

## Why is this bad?

Using various methods from these modules to parse untrusted XML data is
known to be vulnerable to XML attacks. Replace vulnerable imports with the
equivalent `defusedxml` package, or make sure `defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()` is
called before parsing XML data.

## Example

```python
import xml.etree.cElementTree
```
