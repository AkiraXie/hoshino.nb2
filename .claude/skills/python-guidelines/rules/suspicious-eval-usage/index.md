Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the builtin `eval()` function.

## Why is this bad?

The `eval()` function is insecure as it enables arbitrary code execution.

If you need to evaluate an expression from a string, consider using
`ast.literal_eval()` instead, which will raise an exception if the
expression is not a valid Python literal.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to `eval`.

## Example

```python
x = eval(input("Enter a number: "))
```

Use instead:

```python
from ast import literal_eval

x = literal_eval(input("Enter a number: "))
```
