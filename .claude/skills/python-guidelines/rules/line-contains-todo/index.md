## What it does

Checks for "TODO" comments.

## Why is this bad?

"TODO" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved
(usually, a missing feature, optimization, or refactoring opportunity).

Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code.

Note that if you use "TODO" comments as a form of documentation (e.g.,
to [provide context for future work](https://gist.github.com/dmnd/ed5d8ef8de2e4cfea174bd5dafcda382)),
this rule may not be appropriate for your project.

## Example

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"  # TODO: Add support for custom greetings.
```
