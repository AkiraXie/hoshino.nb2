Derived from the **[pydoclint](../#pydoclint-doc)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for function docstrings that do not document all explicitly raised
exceptions.

## Why is this bad?

A function should document all exceptions that are directly raised in some
circumstances. Failing to document an exception that could be raised
can be misleading to users and/or a sign of incomplete documentation.

This rule is not enforced for abstract methods. It is also ignored for
"stub functions": functions where the body only consists of `pass`, `...`,
`raise NotImplementedError`, or similar.

## Example

```python
class FasterThanLightError(ArithmeticError): ...

def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```

Use instead:

```python
class FasterThanLightError(ArithmeticError): ...

def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises:
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```
