Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for redundant definitions of `__str__` or `__repr__` in stubs.

## Why is this bad?

Defining `__str__` or `__repr__` in a stub is almost always redundant,
as the signatures are almost always identical to those of the default
equivalent, `object.__str__` and `object.__repr__`, respectively.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    def __repr__(self) -> str: ...
```
