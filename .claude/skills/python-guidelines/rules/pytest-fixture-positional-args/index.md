Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.fixture` calls with positional arguments.

## Why is this bad?

For clarity and consistency, prefer using keyword arguments to specify
fixture configuration.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture("module")
def my_fixture(): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def my_fixture(): ...
```
