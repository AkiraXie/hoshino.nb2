Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `pass` statements in empty stub bodies.

## Why is this bad?

For stylistic consistency, `...` should always be used rather than `pass`
in stub files.

## Example

```python
def foo(bar: int) -> list[int]: pass
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(bar: int) -> list[int]: ...
```
