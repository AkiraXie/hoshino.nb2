Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for over-indented code.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#indentation), 4 spaces per indentation level should be preferred. Increased
indentation can lead to inconsistent formatting, which can hurt
readability.

## Example

```python
for item in items:
      pass
```

Use instead:

```python
for item in items:
    pass
```

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/). The
formatter enforces consistent indentation, making the rule redundant.
