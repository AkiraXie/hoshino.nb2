Derived from the **[flake8-pie](../#flake8-pie-pie)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `range` calls with an unnecessary `start` argument.

## Why is this bad?

`range(0, x)` is equivalent to `range(x)`, as `0` is the default value for
the `start` argument. Omitting the `start` argument makes the code more
concise and idiomatic.

## Example

```python
range(0, 3)
```

Use instead:

```python
range(3)
```
