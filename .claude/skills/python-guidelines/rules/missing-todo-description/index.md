Derived from the **[flake8-todos](../#flake8-todos-td)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that a "TODO" tag contains a description of the issue following the
tag itself.

## Why is this bad?

TODO comments should include a description of the issue to provide context
for future readers.

## Example

```python
# TODO(charlie)
```

Use instead:

```python
# TODO(charlie): fix some issue
```
