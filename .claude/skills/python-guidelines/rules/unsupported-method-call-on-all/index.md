Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that `append`, `extend` and `remove` methods are not called on
`__all__`.

## Why is this bad?

Different type checkers have varying levels of support for calling these
methods on `__all__`. Instead, use the `+=` operator to add items to
`__all__`, which is known to be supported by all major type checkers.

## Example

```python
import sys

__all__ = ["A", "B"]

if sys.version_info >= (3, 10):
    __all__.append("C")

if sys.version_info >= (3, 11):
    __all__.remove("B")
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

__all__ = ["A"]

if sys.version_info < (3, 11):
    __all__ += ["B"]

if sys.version_info >= (3, 10):
    __all__ += ["C"]
```
