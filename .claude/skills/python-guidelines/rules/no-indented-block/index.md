Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for indented blocks that are lacking indentation.

## Why is this bad?

All indented blocks should be indented; otherwise, they are not valid
Python syntax.

## Example

```python
for item in items:
pass
```

Use instead:

```python
for item in items:
    pass
```
