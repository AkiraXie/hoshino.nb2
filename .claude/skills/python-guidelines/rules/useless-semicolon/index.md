Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for statements that end with an unnecessary semicolon.

## Why is this bad?

A trailing semicolon is unnecessary and should be removed.

## Example

```python
do_four();  # useless semicolon
```

Use instead:

```python
do_four()
```
