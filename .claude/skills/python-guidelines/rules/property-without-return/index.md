This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Detects class `@property` methods that does not have a `return` statement.

## Why is this bad?

Property methods are expected to return a computed value, a missing return in a property usually indicates an implementation mistake.

## Example

```python
class User:
    @property
    def full_name(self):
        f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"
```

Use instead:

```python
class User:
    @property
    def full_name(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"
```
