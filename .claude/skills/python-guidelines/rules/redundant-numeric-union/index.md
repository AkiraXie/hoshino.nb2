Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for parameter annotations that contain redundant unions between
builtin numeric types (e.g., `int | float`).

## Why is this bad?

The [typing specification](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/special-types.html#special-cases-for-float-and-complex) states:

> Python’s numeric types `complex`, `float` and `int` are not subtypes of
> each other, but to support common use cases, the type system contains a
> straightforward shortcut: when an argument is annotated as having type
> `float`, an argument of type `int` is acceptable; similar, for an
> argument annotated as having type `complex`, arguments of type `float` or
> `int` are acceptable.

As such, a union that includes both `int` and `float` is redundant in the
specific context of a parameter annotation, as it is equivalent to a union
that only includes `float`. For readability and clarity, unions should omit
redundant elements.

## Example

```python
def foo(x: float | int | str) -> None: ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(x: float | str) -> None: ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the type annotation contains comments.

Note that while the fix may flatten nested unions into a single top-level union,
the semantics of the annotation will remain unchanged.
