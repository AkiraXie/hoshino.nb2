Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for single strings assigned to `__slots__`.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, the `__slots__` attribute allows you to explicitly define the
attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python
uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory
overhead. However, when `__slots__` is defined, Python uses a more compact
internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory
savings.

Any string iterable may be assigned to `__slots__` (most commonly, a
`tuple` of strings). If a string is assigned to `__slots__`, it is
interpreted as a single attribute name, rather than an iterable of attribute
names. This can cause confusion, as users that iterate over the `__slots__`
value may expect to iterate over a sequence of attributes, but would instead
iterate over the characters of the string.

To use a single string attribute in `__slots__`, wrap the string in an
iterable container type, like a `tuple`.

## Example

```python
class Person:
    __slots__: str = "name"

    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
```

Use instead:

```python
class Person:
    __slots__: tuple[str, ...] = ("name",)

    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
```
