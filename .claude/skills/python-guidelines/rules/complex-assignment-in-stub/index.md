## What it does

Checks for assignments with multiple or non-name targets in stub files.

## Why is this bad?

In general, stub files should be thought of as "data files" for a type
checker, and are not intended to be executed. As such, it's useful to
enforce that only a subset of Python syntax is allowed in a stub file, to
ensure that everything in the stub is unambiguous for the type checker.

The need to perform multi-assignment, or assignment to a non-name target,
likely indicates a misunderstanding of how stub files are intended to be
used.

## Example

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

a = b = int

class Klass: ...

Klass.X: TypeAlias = int
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

a: TypeAlias = int
b: TypeAlias = int

class Klass:
    X: TypeAlias = int
```
