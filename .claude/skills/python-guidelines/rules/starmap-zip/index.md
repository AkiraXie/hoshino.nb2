Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `itertools.starmap` calls where the second argument is a `zip` call.

## Why is this bad?

`zip`-ping iterables only to unpack them later from within `starmap` is unnecessary.
For such cases, `map()` should be used instead.

## Example

```python
from itertools import starmap

starmap(func, zip(a, b))
starmap(func, zip(a, b, strict=True))
```

Use instead:

```python
map(func, a, b)
map(func, a, b, strict=True)  # 3.14+
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the `starmap` or `zip` expressions contain comments that
would be deleted by applying the fix. Otherwise, the fix can be applied safely.

## Fix availability

This rule will emit a diagnostic but not suggest a fix if `map` has been shadowed from its
builtin binding.
