Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `assert False`.

## Why is this bad?

Python removes `assert` statements when running in optimized mode
(`python -O`), making `assert False` an unreliable means of
raising an `AssertionError`.

Instead, raise an `AssertionError` directly.

## Example

```python
assert False
```

Use instead:

```python
raise AssertionError
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as changing an `assert` to a
`raise` will change the behavior of your program when running in
optimized mode (`python -O`).
