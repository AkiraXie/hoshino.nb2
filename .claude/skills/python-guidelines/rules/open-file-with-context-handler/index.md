Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for cases where files are opened (e.g., using the builtin `open()` function)
without using a context manager.

## Why is this bad?

If a file is opened without a context manager, it is not guaranteed that
the file will be closed (e.g., if an exception is raised), which can cause
resource leaks. The rule detects a wide array of IO calls where context managers
could be used, such as `open`, `pathlib.Path(...).open()`, `tempfile.TemporaryFile()`
or`tarfile.TarFile(...).gzopen()`.

## Example

```python
file = open("foo.txt")
...
file.close()
```

Use instead:

```python
with open("foo.txt") as file:
    ...
```
