Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for duplicate union members.

## Why is this bad?

Duplicate union members are redundant and should be removed.

## Example

```python
foo: str | str
```

Use instead:

```python
foo: str
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe unless the union contains comments.

For nested union, the fix will flatten type expressions into a single
top-level union.
