## What it does

Checks for code that raises `Exception` or `BaseException` directly.

## Why is this bad?

Handling such exceptions requires the use of `except Exception` or
`except BaseException`. These will capture almost *any* raised exception,
including failed assertions, division by zero, and more.

Prefer to raise your own exception, or a more specific built-in
exception, so that you can avoid over-capturing exceptions that you
don't intend to handle.

## Example

```python
def main_function():
    if not cond:
        raise Exception()

def consumer_func():
    try:
        do_step()
        prepare()
        main_function()
    except Exception:
        logger.error("Oops")
```

Use instead:

```python
def main_function():
    if not cond:
        raise CustomException()

def consumer_func():
    try:
        do_step()
        prepare()
        main_function()
    except CustomException:
        logger.error("Main function failed")
    except Exception:
        logger.error("Oops")
```
