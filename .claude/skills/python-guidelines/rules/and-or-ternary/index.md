## Removal

This rule was removed from Ruff because it was common for it to introduce behavioral changes.
See [#9007](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9007) for more information.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the known pre-Python 2.5 ternary syntax.

## Why is this bad?

Prior to the introduction of the if-expression (ternary) operator in Python
2.5, the only way to express a conditional expression was to use the `and`
and `or` operators.

The if-expression construct is clearer and more explicit, and should be
preferred over the use of `and` and `or` for ternary expressions.

## Example

```python
x, y = 1, 2
maximum = x >= y and x or y
```

Use instead:

```python
x, y = 1, 2
maximum = x if x >= y else y
```
