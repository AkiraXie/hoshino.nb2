Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for dictionary iterations that extract the dictionary value
via explicit indexing, instead of using `.items()`.

## Why is this bad?

Iterating over a dictionary with `.items()` is semantically clearer
and more efficient than extracting the value with the key.

## Example

```python
ORCHESTRA = {
    "violin": "strings",
    "oboe": "woodwind",
    "tuba": "brass",
    "gong": "percussion",
}

for instrument in ORCHESTRA:
    print(f"{instrument}: {ORCHESTRA[instrument]}")
```

Use instead:

```python
ORCHESTRA = {
    "violin": "strings",
    "oboe": "woodwind",
    "tuba": "brass",
    "gong": "percussion",
}

for instrument, section in ORCHESTRA.items():
    print(f"{instrument}: {section}")
```
