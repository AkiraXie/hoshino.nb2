Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of names that are declared as `global` prior to the
relevant `global` declaration.

## Why is this bad?

The `global` declaration applies to the entire scope. Using a name that's
declared as `global` in a given scope prior to the relevant `global`
declaration is a `SyntaxError`.

## Example

```python
counter = 1

def increment():
    print(f"Adding 1 to {counter}")
    global counter
    counter += 1
```

Use instead:

```python
counter = 1

def increment():
    global counter
    print(f"Adding 1 to {counter}")
    counter += 1
```
