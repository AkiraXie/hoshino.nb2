Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for private type alias definitions suffixed with 'T'.

## Why is this bad?

It's conventional to use the 'T' suffix for type variables; the use of
such a suffix implies that the object is a `TypeVar`.

Adding the 'T' suffix to a non-`TypeVar`, it can be misleading and should
be avoided.

## Example

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

_MyTypeT: TypeAlias = int
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

_MyType: TypeAlias = int
```
