Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.fixture` calls with `scope="function"`.

## Why is this bad?

`scope="function"` can be omitted, as it is the default.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def my_fixture(): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def my_fixture(): ...
```
