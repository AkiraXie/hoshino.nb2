Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for list reversals that can be performed in-place in lieu of
creating a new list.

## Why is this bad?

When reversing a list, it's more efficient to use the in-place method
`.reverse()` instead of creating a new list, if the original list is
no longer needed.

## Example

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
l = reversed(l)

l = [1, 2, 3]
l = list(reversed(l))

l = [1, 2, 3]
l = l[::-1]
```

Use instead:

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
l.reverse()
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as calling `.reverse()` on a list
will mutate the list in-place, unlike `reversed`, which creates a new list
and leaves the original list unchanged.

If the list is referenced elsewhere, this could lead to unexpected
behavior.
