Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `xml.etree.cElementTree` module.

## Why is this bad?

In Python 3.3, `xml.etree.cElementTree` was deprecated in favor of
`xml.etree.ElementTree`.

## Example

```python
from xml.etree import cElementTree as ET
```

Use instead:

```python
from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET
```
