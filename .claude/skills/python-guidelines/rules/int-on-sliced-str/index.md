Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `int` with an explicit base in which a string expression
is stripped of its leading prefix (i.e., `0b`, `0o`, or `0x`).

## Why is this bad?

Given an integer string with a prefix (e.g., `0xABC`), Python can automatically
determine the base of the integer by the prefix without needing to specify
it explicitly.

Instead of `int(num[2:], 16)`, use `int(num, 0)`, which will automatically
deduce the base based on the prefix.

## Example

```python
num = "0xABC"

if num.startswith("0b"):
    i = int(num[2:], 2)
elif num.startswith("0o"):
    i = int(num[2:], 8)
elif num.startswith("0x"):
    i = int(num[2:], 16)

print(i)
```

Use instead:

```python
num = "0xABC"

i = int(num, 0)

print(i)
```

## Fix safety

The rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as Ruff cannot guarantee that the
argument to `int` will remain valid when its base is included in the
function call.
