Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `os.path.join`.

## Why is this bad?

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to
the lower-level API offered by `os.path`. When possible, using `Path` object
methods such as `Path.joinpath()` or the `/` operator can improve
readability over the `os.path` module's counterparts (e.g., `os.path.join()`).

## Examples

```python
import os

os.path.join(os.path.join(ROOT_PATH, "folder"), "file.py")
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

Path(ROOT_PATH) / "folder" / "file.py"
```

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.
