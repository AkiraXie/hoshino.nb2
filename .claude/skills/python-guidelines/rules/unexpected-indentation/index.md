Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for unexpected indentation.

## Why is this bad?

Indentation outside of a code block is not valid Python syntax.

## Example

```python
a = 1
    b = 2
```

Use instead:

```python
a = 1
b = 2
```
