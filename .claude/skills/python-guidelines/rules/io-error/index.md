## What it does

This is not a regular diagnostic; instead, it's raised when a file cannot be read
from disk.

## Why is this bad?

An `IOError` indicates an error in the development setup. For example, the user may
not have permissions to read a given file, or the filesystem may contain a broken
symlink.

## Example

On Linux or macOS:

```python
$ echo 'print("hello world!")' > a.py
$ chmod 000 a.py
$ ruff a.py
a.py:1:1: E902 Permission denied (os error 13)
Found 1 error.
```
