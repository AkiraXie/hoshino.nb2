Derived from the **[flake8-blind-except](../#flake8-blind-except-ble)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `except` clauses that catch all exceptions. This includes
`except BaseException` and `except Exception`.

## Why is this bad?

Overly broad `except` clauses can lead to unexpected behavior, such as
catching `KeyboardInterrupt` or `SystemExit` exceptions that prevent the
user from exiting the program.

Instead of catching all exceptions, catch only those that are expected to
be raised in the `try` block.

## Example

```python
try:
    foo()
except BaseException:
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
try:
    foo()
except FileNotFoundError:
    ...
```

Exceptions that are re-raised will *not* be flagged, as they're expected to
be caught elsewhere:

```python
try:
    foo()
except BaseException:
    raise
```

Exceptions that are logged with `exc_info` enabled will
*not* be flagged, as this is a common pattern for propagating exception
traces:

```python
try:
    foo()
except BaseException:
    logging.exception("Something went wrong")
```
