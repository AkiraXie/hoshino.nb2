Derived from the **[pandas-vet](../#pandas-vet-pd)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `.values` on Pandas Series and Index objects.

## Why is this bad?

The `.values` attribute is ambiguous as its return type is unclear. As
such, it is no longer recommended by the Pandas documentation.

Instead, use `.to_numpy()` to return a NumPy array, or `.array` to return a
Pandas `ExtensionArray`.

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd

animals = pd.read_csv("animals.csv").values  # Ambiguous.
```

Use instead:

```python
import pandas as pd

animals = pd.read_csv("animals.csv").to_numpy()  # Explicit.
```
