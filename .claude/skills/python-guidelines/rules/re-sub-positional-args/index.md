Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for calls to `re.sub`, `re.subn`, and `re.split` that pass `count`,
`maxsplit`, or `flags` as positional arguments.

## Why is this bad?

Passing `count`, `maxsplit`, or `flags` as positional arguments to
`re.sub`, `re.subn`, or `re.split` can lead to confusion, as most methods in
the `re` module accept `flags` as the third positional argument, while
`re.sub`, `re.subn`, and `re.split` have different signatures.

Instead, pass `count`, `maxsplit`, and `flags` as keyword arguments.

## Example

```python
import re

re.split("pattern", "replacement", 1)
```

Use instead:

```python
import re

re.split("pattern", "replacement", maxsplit=1)
```
