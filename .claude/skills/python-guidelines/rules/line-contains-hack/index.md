## What it does

Checks for "HACK" comments.

## Why is this bad?

"HACK" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved
(usually, a suboptimal solution or temporary workaround).

Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code.

Note that if you use "HACK" comments as a form of documentation, this
rule may not be appropriate for your project.

## Example

```python
import os

def running_windows():  # HACK: Use platform module instead.
    try:
        os.mkdir("C:\\Windows\\System32\\")
    except FileExistsError:
        return True
    else:
        os.rmdir("C:\\Windows\\System32\\")
        return False
```
