Derived from the **[tryceratops](../#tryceratops-try)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `raise` statements within `try` blocks. The only `raise`s
caught are those that throw exceptions caught by the `try` statement itself.

## Why is this bad?

Raising and catching exceptions within the same `try` block is redundant,
as the code can be refactored to avoid the `try` block entirely.

Alternatively, the `raise` can be moved within an inner function, making
the exception reusable across multiple call sites.

## Example

```python
def bar():
    pass

def foo():
    try:
        a = bar()
        if not a:
            raise ValueError
    except ValueError:
        raise
```

Use instead:

```python
def bar():
    raise ValueError

def foo():
    try:
        a = bar()  # refactored `bar` to raise `ValueError`
    except ValueError:
        raise
```
