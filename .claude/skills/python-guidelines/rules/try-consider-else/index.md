Derived from the **[tryceratops](../#tryceratops-try)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `return` statements in `try` blocks.

## Why is this bad?

The `try`-`except` statement has an `else` clause for code that should
run *only* if no exceptions were raised. Returns in `try` blocks may
exhibit confusing or unwanted behavior, such as being overridden by
control flow in `except` and `finally` blocks, or unintentionally
suppressing an exception.

## Example

```python
import logging

def reciprocal(n):
    try:
        rec = 1 / n
        print(f"reciprocal of {n} is {rec}")
        return rec
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        logging.exception("Exception occurred")
        raise
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

def reciprocal(n):
    try:
        rec = 1 / n
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        logging.exception("Exception occurred")
        raise
    else:
        print(f"reciprocal of {n} is {rec}")
        return rec
```
