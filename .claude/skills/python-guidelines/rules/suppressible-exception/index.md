Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `try`-`except`-`pass` blocks that can be replaced with the
`contextlib.suppress` context manager.

## Why is this bad?

Using `contextlib.suppress` is more concise and directly communicates the
intent of the code: to suppress a given exception.

Note that `contextlib.suppress` is slower than using `try`-`except`-`pass`
directly. For performance-critical code, consider retaining the
`try`-`except`-`pass` pattern.

## Example

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
import contextlib

with contextlib.suppress(ZeroDivisionError):
    1 / 0
```
