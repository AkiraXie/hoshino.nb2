Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for redundant unions between a `Literal` and a builtin supertype of
that `Literal`.

## Why is this bad?

Using a `Literal` type in a union with its builtin supertype is redundant,
as the supertype will be strictly more general than the `Literal` type.
For example, `Literal["A"] | str` is equivalent to `str`, and
`Literal[1] | int` is equivalent to `int`, as `str` and `int` are the
supertypes of `"A"` and `1` respectively.

## Example

```python
from typing import Literal

x: Literal["A", b"B"] | str
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import Literal

x: Literal[b"B"] | str
```
