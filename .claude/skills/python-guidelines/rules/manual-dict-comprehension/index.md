Derived from the **[Perflint](../#perflint-perf)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `for` loops that can be replaced by a dictionary comprehension.

## Why is this bad?

When creating or extending a dictionary in a for-loop, prefer a dictionary
comprehension. Comprehensions are more readable and more performant.

For example, when comparing `{x: x for x in list(range(1000))}` to the `for`
loop version, the comprehension is ~10% faster on Python 3.11.

Note that, as with all `perflint` rules, this is only intended as a
micro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in
most cases.

## Example

```python
pairs = (("a", 1), ("b", 2))
result = {}
for x, y in pairs:
    if y % 2:
        result[x] = y
```

Use instead:

```python
pairs = (("a", 1), ("b", 2))
result = {x: y for x, y in pairs if y % 2}
```

If you're appending to an existing dictionary, use the `update` method instead:

```python
pairs = (("a", 1), ("b", 2))
result.update({x: y for x, y in pairs if y % 2})
```
