Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for redundant `Final[Literal[...]]` annotations.

## Why is this bad?

All constant variables annotated as `Final` are understood as implicitly
having `Literal` types by a type checker. As such, a `Final[Literal[...]]`
annotation can often be replaced with a bare `Final`, annotation, which
will have the same meaning to the type checker while being more concise and
more readable.

## Example

```python
from typing import Final, Literal

x: Final[Literal[42]]
y: Final[Literal[42]] = 42
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import Final, Literal

x: Final = 42
y: Final = 42
```
