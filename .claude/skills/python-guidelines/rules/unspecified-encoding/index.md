Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `open` and related calls without an explicit `encoding`
argument.

## Why is this bad?

Using `open` in text mode without an explicit encoding can lead to
non-portable code, with differing behavior across platforms. While readers
may assume that UTF-8 is the default encoding, in reality, the default
is locale-specific.

Instead, consider using the `encoding` parameter to enforce a specific
encoding. [PEP 597](https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/) recommends the use of `encoding="utf-8"` as a default,
and suggests that it may become the default in future versions of Python.

If a locale-specific encoding is intended, use `encoding="locale"` on
Python 3.10 and later, or `locale.getpreferredencoding()` on earlier versions,
to make the encoding explicit.

## Fix safety

This fix is always unsafe and may change the program's behavior. It forces
`encoding="utf-8"` as the default, regardless of the platform’s actual default
encoding, which may cause `UnicodeDecodeError` on non-UTF-8 systems.

```python
with open("test.txt") as f:
    print(f.read()) # before fix (on UTF-8 systems): 你好，世界！
with open("test.txt", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    print(f.read()) # after fix (on Windows): UnicodeDecodeError
```

## Example

```python
open("file.txt")
```

Use instead:

```python
open("file.txt", encoding="utf-8")
```
