This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for imports of the `pyghmi` module.

## Why is this bad?

`pyghmi` is an IPMI-related module, but IPMI is considered insecure.
Instead, use an encrypted protocol.

## Example

```python
import pyghmi
```
