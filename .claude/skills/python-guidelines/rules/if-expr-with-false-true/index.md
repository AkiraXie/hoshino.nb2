Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `if` expressions that can be replaced by negating a given
condition.

## Why is this bad?

`if` expressions that evaluate to `False` for a truthy condition and `True`
for a falsey condition can be replaced with `not` operators, which are more
concise and readable.

## Example

```python
False if a else True
```

Use instead:

```python
not a
```
