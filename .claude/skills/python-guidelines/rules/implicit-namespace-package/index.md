Derived from the **[flake8-no-pep420](../#flake8-no-pep420-inp)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for packages that are missing an `__init__.py` file.

## Why is this bad?

Python packages are directories that contain a file named `__init__.py`.
The existence of this file indicates that the directory is a Python
package, and so it can be imported the same way a module can be
imported.

Directories that lack an `__init__.py` file can still be imported, but
they're indicative of a special kind of package, known as a "namespace
package" (see: [PEP 420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/)).
Namespace packages are less widely used, so a package that lacks an
`__init__.py` file is typically meant to be a regular package, and
the absence of the `__init__.py` file is probably an oversight.

## Options

- [`namespace-packages`](../../settings/#namespace-packages)
