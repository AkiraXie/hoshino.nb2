Derived from the **[Airflow](../#airflow-air)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that the task variable name matches the `task_id` value for
Airflow Operators.

## Why is this bad?

When initializing an Airflow Operator, for consistency, the variable
name should match the `task_id` value. This makes it easier to
follow the flow of the Dag.

## Example

```python
from airflow.operators import PythonOperator

incorrect_name = PythonOperator(task_id="my_task")
```

Use instead:

```python
from airflow.operators import PythonOperator

my_task = PythonOperator(task_id="my_task")
```
