Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `int` conversions of values that are already integers.

## Why is this bad?

Such a conversion is unnecessary.

## Known problems

This rule may produce false positives for `round`, `math.ceil`, `math.floor`,
and `math.trunc` calls when values override the `__round__`, `__ceil__`, `__floor__`,
or `__trunc__` operators such that they don't return an integer.

## Example

```python
int(len([]))
int(round(foo, None))
```

Use instead:

```python
len([])
round(foo)
```

## Fix safety

The fix for `round`, `math.ceil`, `math.floor`, and `math.truncate` is unsafe
because removing the `int` conversion can change the semantics for values
overriding the `__round__`, `__ceil__`, `__floor__`, or `__trunc__` dunder methods
such that they don't return an integer.
