Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for imports of `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler` and
`twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript`.

## Why is this bad?

httpoxy is a set of vulnerabilities that affect application code running in
CGI or CGI-like environments. The use of CGI for web applications should be
avoided to prevent this class of attack.

## Example

```python
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
```
