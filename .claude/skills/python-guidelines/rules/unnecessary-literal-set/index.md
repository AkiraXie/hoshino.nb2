Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `set()` calls that take unnecessary list or tuple literals
as arguments.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to use a list or tuple literal within a call to `set()`.
Instead, the expression can be rewritten as a set literal.

## Example

```python
set([1, 2])
set((1, 2))
set([])
```

Use instead:

```python
{1, 2}
{1, 2}
set()
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
