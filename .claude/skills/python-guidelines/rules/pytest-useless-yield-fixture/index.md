Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `yield` expressions in `pytest` fixtures.

## Why is this bad?

In `pytest` fixtures, the `yield` expression should only be used for fixtures
that include teardown code, to clean up the fixture after the test function
has finished executing.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def my_fixture():
    resource = acquire_resource()
    yield resource
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def my_fixture_with_teardown():
    resource = acquire_resource()
    yield resource
    resource.release()

@pytest.fixture()
def my_fixture_without_teardown():
    resource = acquire_resource()
    return resource
```
