Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for classes that inherit from `object`.

## Why is this bad?

Since Python 3, all classes inherit from `object` by default, so `object` can
be omitted from the list of base classes.

## Example

```python
class Foo(object): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo: ...
```

## Fix safety

This fix is unsafe if it would cause comments to be deleted.
