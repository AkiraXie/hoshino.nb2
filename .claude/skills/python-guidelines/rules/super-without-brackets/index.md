Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Detects attempts to use `super` without parentheses.

## Why is this bad?

The [`super()` callable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super)
can be used inside method definitions to create a proxy object that
delegates attribute access to a superclass of the current class. Attempting
to access attributes on `super` itself, however, instead of the object
returned by a call to `super()`, will raise `AttributeError`.

## Example

```python
class Animal:
    @staticmethod
    def speak():
        return "This animal says something."

class Dog(Animal):
    @staticmethod
    def speak():
        original_speak = super.speak()  # ERROR: `super.speak()`
        return f"{original_speak} But as a dog, it barks!"
```

Use instead:

```python
class Animal:
    @staticmethod
    def speak():
        return "This animal says something."

class Dog(Animal):
    @staticmethod
    def speak():
        original_speak = super().speak()  # Correct: `super().speak()`
        return f"{original_speak} But as a dog, it barks!"
```

## Options

This rule applies to regular, static, and class methods. You can customize how Ruff categorizes
methods with the following options:

- [`lint.pep8-naming.classmethod-decorators`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_classmethod-decorators)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.staticmethod-decorators`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_staticmethod-decorators)
