## Removed

This rule has been removed because type checkers can infer this type without annotation.

## What it does

Checks that instance method `self` arguments have type annotations.

## Why is this bad?

Type annotations are a good way to document the types of function arguments. They also
help catch bugs, when used alongside a type checker, by ensuring that the types of
any provided arguments match expectation.

Note that many type checkers will infer the type of `self` automatically, so this
annotation is not strictly necessary.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    def bar(self): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    def bar(self: "Foo"): ...
```
