Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `type` that compare the type of an object to the type of `None`.

## Why is this bad?

There is only ever one instance of `None`, so it is more efficient and
readable to use the `is` operator to check if an object is `None`.

## Example

```python
type(obj) is type(None)
```

Use instead:

```python
obj is None
```

## Fix safety

If the fix might remove comments, it will be marked as unsafe.
