Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `__len__` implementations that return values that are not non-negative
integers.

## Why is this bad?

The `__len__` method should return a non-negative integer. Returning a different
value may cause unexpected behavior.

Note: `bool` is a subclass of `int`, so it's technically valid for `__len__` to
return `True` or `False`. However, for consistency with other rules, Ruff will
still emit a diagnostic when `__len__` returns a `bool`.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    def __len__(self):
        return "2"
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    def __len__(self):
        return 2
```
