Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for exception handlers that catch an empty tuple.

## Why is this bad?

An exception handler that catches an empty tuple will not catch anything,
and is indicative of a mistake. Instead, add exceptions to the `except`
clause.

## Example

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ():
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    ...
```
