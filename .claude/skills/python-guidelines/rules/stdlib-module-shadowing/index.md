Derived from the **[flake8-builtins](../#flake8-builtins-a)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for modules that use the same names as Python standard-library
modules.

## Why is this bad?

Reusing a standard-library module name for the name of a module increases
the difficulty of reading and maintaining the code, and can cause
non-obvious errors. Readers may mistake the first-party module for the
standard-library module and vice versa.

Standard-library modules can be marked as exceptions to this rule via the
[`lint.flake8-builtins.allowed-modules`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_allowed-modules) configuration option.

By default, the module path relative to the project root or [`src`](../../settings/#src) directories is considered,
so a top-level `logging.py` or `logging/__init__.py` will clash with the builtin `logging`
module, but `utils/logging.py`, for example, will not. With the
[`lint.flake8-builtins.strict-checking`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_strict-checking) option set to `true`, only the last component
of the module name is considered, so `logging.py`, `utils/logging.py`, and
`utils/logging/__init__.py` will all trigger the rule.

This rule is not applied to stub files, as the name of a stub module is out
of the control of the author of the stub file. Instead, a stub should aim to
faithfully emulate the runtime module it is stubbing.

As of Python 3.13, errors from modules that use the same name as
standard-library modules now display a custom message.

## Example

```python
$ touch random.py
$ python3 -c 'from random import choice'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
    from random import choice
ImportError: cannot import name 'choice' from 'random' (consider renaming '/random.py' since it has the same name as the standard library module named 'random' and prevents importing that standard library module)
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-builtins.allowed-modules`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_allowed-modules)
- [`lint.flake8-builtins.strict-checking`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_strict-checking)
