Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for global variable names that follow the `mixedCase` convention.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#global-variable-names) recommends that global variable names should be lower case and
separated by underscores (also known as `snake_case`).

> ### Global Variable Names
>
> (Let’s hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module
> only.) The conventions are about the same as those for functions.
>
> Modules that are designed for use via `from M import *` should use the
> `__all__` mechanism to prevent exporting globals, or use the older
> convention of prefixing such globals with an underscore (which you might
> want to do to indicate these globals are “module non-public”).
>
> ### Function and Variable Names
>
> Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores
> as necessary to improve readability.
>
> Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
>
> mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the prevailing
> style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

## Example

```python
myVariable = "hello"
another_variable = "world"
yet_anotherVariable = "foo"
```

Use instead:

```python
my_variable = "hello"
another_variable = "world"
yet_another_variable = "foo"
```
