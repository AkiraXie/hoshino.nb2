Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for parameters of test functions with default arguments.

## Why is this bad?

Such a parameter will always have the default value during the test
regardless of whether a fixture with the same name is defined.

## Example

```python
def test_foo(a=1): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def test_foo(a): ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as modifying a function signature can
change the behavior of the code.
