Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for class variable names that follow the `mixedCase` convention.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-method-arguments) recommends that variable names should be lower case and separated
by underscores (also known as `snake_case`).

> Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores
> as necessary to improve readability.
>
> Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
>
> mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the
> prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

## Example

```python
class MyClass:
    myVariable = "hello"
    another_variable = "world"
```

Use instead:

```python
class MyClass:
    my_variable = "hello"
    another_variable = "world"
```
