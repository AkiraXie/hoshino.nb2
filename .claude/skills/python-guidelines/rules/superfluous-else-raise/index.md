Derived from the **[flake8-return](../#flake8-return-ret)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `else` statements with a `raise` statement in the preceding `if`
block.

## Why is this bad?

The `else` statement is not needed as the `raise` statement will always
break out of the current scope. Removing the `else` will reduce nesting
and make the code more readable.

## Example

```python
def foo(bar, baz):
    if bar == "Specific Error":
        raise Exception(bar)
    else:
        raise Exception(baz)
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(bar, baz):
    if bar == "Specific Error":
        raise Exception(bar)
    raise Exception(baz)
```
