Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `assert` statements that use a string literal as the first
argument.

## Why is this bad?

An `assert` on a non-empty string literal will always pass, while an
`assert` on an empty string literal will always fail.

## Example

```python
assert "always true"
```
