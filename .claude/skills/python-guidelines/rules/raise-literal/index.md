## What it does

Checks for `raise` statements that raise a literal value.

## Why is this bad?

`raise` must be followed by an exception instance or an exception class,
and exceptions must be instances of `BaseException` or a subclass thereof.
Raising a literal will raise a `TypeError` at runtime.

## Example

```python
raise "foo"
```

Use instead:

```python
raise Exception("foo")
```
