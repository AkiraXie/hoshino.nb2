Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for imports of the `pickle`, `cPickle`, `dill`, and `shelve` modules.

## Why is this bad?

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute
arbitrary code during unpickling. Consider possible security implications
associated with these modules.

## Example

```python
import pickle
```
