**Warning: This rule has been removed and its documentation is only available for historical reasons.**

## Removed

This rule was implemented in `flake8-bugbear` and has been remapped to [B035](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/static-key-dict-comprehension/)

## What it does

Checks for dictionary comprehensions that use a static key, like a string
literal or a variable defined outside the comprehension.

## Why is this bad?

Using a static key (like a string literal) in a dictionary comprehension
is usually a mistake, as it will result in a dictionary with only one key,
despite the comprehension iterating over multiple values.

## Example

```python
data = ["some", "Data"]
{"key": value.upper() for value in data}
```

Use instead:

```python
data = ["some", "Data"]
{value: value.upper() for value in data}
```
