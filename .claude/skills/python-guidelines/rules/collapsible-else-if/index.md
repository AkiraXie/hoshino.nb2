Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `else` blocks that consist of a single `if` statement.

## Why is this bad?

If an `else` block contains a single `if` statement, it can be collapsed
into an `elif`, thus reducing the indentation level.

## Example

```python
def check_sign(value: int) -> None:
    if value > 0:
        print("Number is positive.")
    else:
        if value < 0:
            print("Number is negative.")
        else:
            print("Number is zero.")
```

Use instead:

```python
def check_sign(value: int) -> None:
    if value > 0:
        print("Number is positive.")
    elif value < 0:
        print("Number is negative.")
    else:
        print("Number is zero.")
```
