Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of the `try`-`except`-`pass` pattern.

## Why is this bad?

The `try`-`except`-`pass` pattern suppresses all exceptions. Suppressing
exceptions may hide errors that could otherwise reveal unexpected behavior,
security vulnerabilities, or malicious activity. Instead, consider logging
the exception.

## Example

```python
try:
    ...
except Exception:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

try:
    ...
except Exception as exc:
    logging.exception("Exception occurred")
```
