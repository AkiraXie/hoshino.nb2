Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `os.path.dirname`.

## Why is this bad?

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to
the lower-level API offered by `os.path`. When possible, using `Path` object
methods such as `Path.parent` can improve readability over the `os.path`
module's counterparts (e.g., `os.path.dirname()`).

## Examples

```python
import os

os.path.dirname(__file__)
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

Path(__file__).parent
```

## Fix Safety

This rule's fix is always marked as unsafe because the replacement is not always semantically
equivalent to the original code. In particular, `pathlib` performs path normalization,
which can alter the result compared to `os.path.dirname`. For example, this normalization:

- Collapses consecutive slashes (e.g., `"a//b"` → `"a/b"`).
- Removes trailing slashes (e.g., `"a/b/"` → `"a/b"`).
- Eliminates `"."` (e.g., `"a/./b"` → `"a/b"`).

As a result, code relying on the exact string returned by `os.path.dirname`
may behave differently after the fix.

Additionally, the fix is marked as unsafe because `os.path.dirname()` returns `str` or `bytes` (`AnyStr`),
while `Path.parent` returns a `Path` object. This change in return type can break code that uses
the return value.

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.
