Derived from the **[Perflint](../#perflint-perf)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for explicit casts to `list` on for-loop iterables.

## Why is this bad?

Using a `list()` call to eagerly iterate over an already-iterable type
(like a tuple, list, or set) is inefficient, as it forces Python to create
a new list unnecessarily.

Removing the `list()` call will not change the behavior of the code, but
may improve performance.

Note that, as with all `perflint` rules, this is only intended as a
micro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in
most cases.

## Example

```python
items = (1, 2, 3)
for i in list(items):
    print(i)
```

Use instead:

```python
items = (1, 2, 3)
for i in items:
    print(i)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there's comments in the
`list()` call, as comments may be removed.

For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case:

```python
items = (1, 2, 3)
for i in list(  # comment
    items
):
    print(i)
```
