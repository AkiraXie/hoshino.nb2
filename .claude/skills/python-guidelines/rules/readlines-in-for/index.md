Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `readlines()` when iterating over a file line-by-line.

## Why is this bad?

Rather than iterating over all lines in a file by calling `readlines()`,
it's more convenient and performant to iterate over the file object
directly.

## Example

```python
with open("file.txt") as fp:
    for line in fp.readlines():
        ...
```

Use instead:

```python
with open("file.txt") as fp:
    for line in fp:
        ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there's comments in the
`readlines()` call, as comments may be removed.

For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case:

```python
with open("file.txt") as fp:
    for line in (  # comment
        fp.readlines()  # comment
    ):
        ...
```
