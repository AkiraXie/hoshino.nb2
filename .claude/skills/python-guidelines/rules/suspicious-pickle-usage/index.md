## What it does

Checks for calls to `pickle` functions or modules that wrap them.

## Why is this bad?

Deserializing untrusted data with `pickle` and other deserialization
modules is insecure as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects,
which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise
unexpected behavior.

Avoid deserializing untrusted data with `pickle` and other deserialization
modules. Instead, consider safer formats, such as JSON.

If you must deserialize untrusted data with `pickle`, consider signing the
data with a secret key and verifying the signature before deserializing the
payload, This will prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary objects
into the serialized data.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to `pickle` functions.

## Example

```python
import pickle

with open("foo.pickle", "rb") as file:
    foo = pickle.load(file)
```

Use instead:

```python
import json

with open("foo.json", "rb") as file:
    foo = json.load(file)
```
