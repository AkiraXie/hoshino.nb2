This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for eager string conversion of arguments to `logging` calls.

## Why is this bad?

Arguments to `logging` calls will be formatted as strings automatically, so it
is unnecessary and less efficient to eagerly format the arguments before passing
them in.

## Known problems

This rule detects uses of the `logging` module via a heuristic.
Specifically, it matches against:

- Uses of the `logging` module itself (e.g., `import logging; logging.info(...)`).
- Uses of `flask.current_app.logger` (e.g., `from flask import current_app; current_app.logger.info(...)`).
- Objects whose name starts with `log` or ends with `logger` or `logging`,
  when used in the same file in which they are defined (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger(); logger.info(...)`).
- Imported objects marked as loggers via the [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects) setting, which can be
  used to enforce these rules against shared logger objects (e.g., `from module import logger; logger.info(...)`,
  when [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects) is set to `["module.logger"]`).

## Example

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format="%(message)s", level=logging.INFO)

user = "Maria"

logging.info("%s - Something happened", str(user))
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format="%(message)s", level=logging.INFO)

user = "Maria"

logging.info("%s - Something happened", user)
```

## Options

- [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects)
