Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `__index__` implementations that return non-integer values.

## Why is this bad?

The `__index__` method should return an integer. Returning a different
type may cause unexpected behavior.

Note: `bool` is a subclass of `int`, so it's technically valid for `__index__` to
return `True` or `False`. However, a `DeprecationWarning` (`DeprecationWarning: __index__ returned non-int (type bool)`) for such cases was already introduced,
thus this is a conscious difference between the original pylint rule and the
current ruff implementation.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    def __index__(self):
        return "2"
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    def __index__(self):
        return 2
```
