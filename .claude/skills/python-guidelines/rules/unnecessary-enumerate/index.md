Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `enumerate` that discard either the index or the value
when iterating over a sequence.

## Why is this bad?

The built-in `enumerate` function is useful when you need both the index and
value of a sequence.

If you only need the index or values of a sequence, you should iterate over
`range(len(...))` or the sequence itself, respectively, instead. This is
more efficient and communicates the intent of the code more clearly.

## Known problems

This rule is prone to false negatives due to type inference limitations;
namely, it will only suggest a fix using the `len` builtin function if the
sequence passed to `enumerate` is an instantiated as a list, set, dict, or
tuple literal, or annotated as such with a type annotation.

The `len` builtin function is not defined for all object types (such as
generators), and so refactoring to use `len` over `enumerate` is not always
safe.

## Example

```python
for index, _ in enumerate(sequence):
    print(index)

for _, value in enumerate(sequence):
    print(value)
```

Use instead:

```python
for index in range(len(sequence)):
    print(index)

for value in sequence:
    print(value)
```
