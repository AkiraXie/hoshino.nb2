Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary generators that can be rewritten as dict
comprehensions.

## Why is this bad?

It is unnecessary to use `dict()` around a generator expression, since
there are equivalent comprehensions for these types. Using a
comprehension is clearer and more idiomatic.

## Example

```python
dict((x, f(x)) for x in foo)
```

Use instead:

```python
{x: f(x) for x in foo}
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
