Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for repeated equality comparisons that can be rewritten as a membership
test.

This rule will try to determine if the values are hashable
and the fix will use a `set` if they are. If unable to determine, the fix
will use a `tuple` and suggest the use of a `set`.

## Why is this bad?

To check if a variable is equal to one of many values, it is common to
write a series of equality comparisons (e.g.,
`foo == "bar" or foo == "baz"`).

Instead, prefer to combine the values into a collection and use the `in`
operator to check for membership, which is more performant and succinct.
If the items are hashable, use a `set` for efficiency; otherwise, use a
`tuple`.

## Fix safety

This rule is always unsafe since literal sets and tuples
evaluate their members eagerly whereas `or` comparisons
are short-circuited. It is therefore possible that a fix
will change behavior in the presence of side-effects.

## Example

```python
foo == "bar" or foo == "baz" or foo == "qux"
```

Use instead:

```python
foo in {"bar", "baz", "qux"}
```
