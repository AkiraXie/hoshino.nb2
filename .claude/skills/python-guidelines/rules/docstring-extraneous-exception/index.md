Derived from the **[pydoclint](../#pydoclint-doc)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for function docstrings that state that exceptions could be raised
even though they are not directly raised in the function body.

## Why is this bad?

Some conventions prefer non-explicit exceptions be omitted from the
docstring.

This rule is not enforced for abstract methods. It is also ignored for
"stub functions": functions where the body only consists of `pass`, `...`,
`raise NotImplementedError`, or similar.

## Example

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises:
        ZeroDivisionError: Divided by zero.
    """
    return distance / time
```

Use instead:

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.
    """
    return distance / time
```

## Known issues

It may often be desirable to document *all* exceptions that a function
could possibly raise, even those which are not explicitly raised using
`raise` statements in the function body.
