Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for dictionary unpacking in a for loop without calling `.items()`.

## Why is this bad?

When iterating over a dictionary in a for loop, if a dictionary is unpacked
without calling `.items()`, it could lead to a runtime error if the keys are not
a tuple of two elements.

It is likely that you're looking for an iteration over (key, value) pairs which
can only be achieved when calling `.items()`.

## Example

```python
data = {"Paris": 2_165_423, "New York City": 8_804_190, "Tokyo": 13_988_129}

for city, population in data:
    print(f"{city} has population {population}.")
```

Use instead:

```python
data = {"Paris": 2_165_423, "New York City": 8_804_190, "Tokyo": 13_988_129}

for city, population in data.items():
    print(f"{city} has population {population}.")
```

## Known problems

If the dictionary key is a tuple, e.g.:

```python
d = {(1, 2): 3, (3, 4): 5}
for x, y in d:
    print(x, y)
```

The tuple key is unpacked into `x` and `y` instead of the key and values. This means that
the suggested fix of using `d.items()` would result in different runtime behavior. Ruff
cannot consistently infer the type of a dictionary's keys.

## Fix safety

Due to the known problem with tuple keys, this fix is unsafe.
