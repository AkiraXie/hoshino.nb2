Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of multiple `type`s in a union.

## Why is this bad?

`type[T | S]` has identical semantics to `type[T] | type[S]` in a type
annotation, but is cleaner and more concise.

## Example

```python
field: type[int] | type[float] | str
```

Use instead:

```python
field: type[int | float] | str
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the type annotation contains comments.

Note that while the fix may flatten nested unions into a single top-level union,
the semantics of the annotation will remain unchanged.
