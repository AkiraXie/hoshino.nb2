Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for `else` clauses that only contains `pass` and `...` statements.

## Why is this bad?

Such an else clause does nothing and can be removed.

## Example

```python
if foo:
    bar()
else:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
if foo:
    bar()
```
