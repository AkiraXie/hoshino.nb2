Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks the following constructs, all of which can be replaced by
`next(iter(...))`:

- `list(...)[0]`
- `tuple(...)[0]`
- `list(i for i in ...)[0]`
- `[i for i in ...][0]`
- `list(...).pop(0)`

## Why is this bad?

Calling e.g. `list(...)` will create a new list of the entire collection,
which can be very expensive for large collections. If you only need the
first element of the collection, you can use `next(...)` or
`next(iter(...)` to lazily fetch the first element. The same is true for
the other constructs.

## Example

```python
head = list(x)[0]
head = [x * x for x in range(10)][0]
```

Use instead:

```python
head = next(iter(x))
head = next(x * x for x in range(10))
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as migrating from (e.g.) `list(...)[0]`
to `next(iter(...))` can change the behavior of your program in two ways:

1. First, all above-mentioned constructs will eagerly evaluate the entire
   collection, while `next(iter(...))` will only evaluate the first
   element. As such, any side effects that occur during iteration will be
   delayed.
2. Second, accessing members of a collection via square bracket notation
   `[0]` or the `pop()` function will raise `IndexError` if the collection
   is empty, while `next(iter(...))` will raise `StopIteration`.
