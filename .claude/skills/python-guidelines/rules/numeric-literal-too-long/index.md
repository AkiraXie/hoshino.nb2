Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for numeric literals with a string representation longer than ten
characters.

## Why is this bad?

If a function has a default value where the literal representation is
greater than 10 characters, the value is likely to be an implementation
detail or a constant that varies depending on the system you're running on.

Default values like these should generally be omitted from stubs. Use
ellipses (`...`) instead.

## Example

```python
def foo(arg: int = 693568516352839939918568862861217771399698285293568) -> None: ...
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(arg: int = ...) -> None: ...
```
