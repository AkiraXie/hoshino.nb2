## What it does

Checks for ambiguous Unicode characters in comments.

## Why is this bad?

Some Unicode characters are visually similar to ASCII characters, but have
different code points. For example, `GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA` (`U+0391`)
is visually similar, but not identical, to the ASCII character `A`.

The use of ambiguous Unicode characters can confuse readers, cause subtle
bugs, and even make malicious code look harmless.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag Unicode characters that are
confusable with other, non-preferred Unicode characters. For example, the
spec recommends `GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA` over `OHM SIGN`.

You can omit characters from being flagged as ambiguous via the
[`lint.allowed-confusables`](../../settings/#lint_allowed-confusables) setting.

## Example

```python
foo()  # nоqa  # "о" is Cyrillic (`U+043E`)
```

Use instead:

```python
foo()  # noqa  # "o" is Latin (`U+006F`)
```

## Options

- [`lint.allowed-confusables`](../../settings/#lint_allowed-confusables)
