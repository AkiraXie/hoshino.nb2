Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary parentheses on `functools.lru_cache` decorators.

## Why is this bad?

Since Python 3.8, `functools.lru_cache` can be used as a decorator without
trailing parentheses, as long as no arguments are passed to it.

## Example

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache()
def foo(): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache
def foo(): ...
```

## Options

- [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version)
