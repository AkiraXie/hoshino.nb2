Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for assertions that combine multiple independent conditions.

## Why is this bad?

Composite assertion statements are harder to debug upon failure, as the
failure message will not indicate which condition failed.

## Example

```python
def test_foo():
    assert something and something_else

def test_bar():
    assert not (something or something_else)
```

Use instead:

```python
def test_foo():
    assert something
    assert something_else

def test_bar():
    assert not something
    assert not something_else
```
