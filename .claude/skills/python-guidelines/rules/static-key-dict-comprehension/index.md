## What it does

Checks for dictionary comprehensions that use a static key, like a string
literal or a variable defined outside the comprehension.

## Why is this bad?

Using a static key (like a string literal) in a dictionary comprehension
is usually a mistake, as it will result in a dictionary with only one key,
despite the comprehension iterating over multiple values.

## Example

```python
data = ["some", "Data"]
{"key": value.upper() for value in data}
```

Use instead:

```python
data = ["some", "Data"]
{value: value.upper() for value in data}
```
