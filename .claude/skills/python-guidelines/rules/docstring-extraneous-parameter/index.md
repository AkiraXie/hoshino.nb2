Derived from the **[pydoclint](../#pydoclint-doc)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for function docstrings that include parameters which are not
in the function signature.

## Why is this bad?

If a docstring documents a parameter which is not in the function signature,
it can be misleading to users and/or a sign of incomplete documentation or
refactors.

## Example

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.
        acceleration: Rate of change of speed.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.
    """
    return distance / time
```

Use instead:

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.
    """
    return distance / time
```
