Derived from the **[eradicate](../#eradicate-era)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for commented-out Python code.

## Why is this bad?

Commented-out code is dead code, and is often included inadvertently.
It should be removed.

## Known problems

Prone to false positives when checking comments that resemble Python code,
but are not actually Python code ([#4845](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4845)).

## Example

```python
# print("Hello, world!")
```

## Options

- [`lint.task-tags`](../../settings/#lint_task-tags)
