Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `or` expressions that include both an expression and its
negation.

## Why is this bad?

An `or` expression that includes both an expression and its negation will
always evaluate to `True`.

## Example

```python
x or not x
```
