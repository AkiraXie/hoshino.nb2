## What it does

Checks for uses of weak or broken cryptographic hash functions.

## Why is this bad?

Weak or broken cryptographic hash functions may be susceptible to
collision attacks (where two different inputs produce the same hash) or
pre-image attacks (where an attacker can find an input that produces a
given hash). This can lead to security vulnerabilities in applications
that rely on these hash functions.

Avoid using weak or broken cryptographic hash functions in security
contexts. Instead, use a known secure hash function such as SHA-256.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to insecure hash functions.

## Example

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes

digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.MD5())
digest.update(b"Hello, world!")
digest.finalize()
```

Use instead:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes

digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
digest.update(b"Hello, world!")
digest.finalize()
```
