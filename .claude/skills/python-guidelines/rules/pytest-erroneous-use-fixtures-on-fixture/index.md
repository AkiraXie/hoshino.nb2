Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `pytest.mark.usefixtures` decorators applied to `pytest`
fixtures.

## Why is this bad?

The `pytest.mark.usefixtures` decorator has no effect on `pytest` fixtures.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def a():
    pass

@pytest.mark.usefixtures("a")
@pytest.fixture()
def b(a):
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
def a():
    pass

@pytest.fixture()
def b(a):
    pass
```
