Derived from the **[flake8-import-conventions](../#flake8-import-conventions-icn)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for imports that are typically imported using a common convention,
like `import pandas as pd`, and enforces that convention.

## Why is this bad?

Consistency is good. Use a common convention for imports to make your code
more readable and idiomatic.

For example, `import pandas as pd` is a common
convention for importing the `pandas` library, and users typically expect
Pandas to be aliased as `pd`.

## Example

```python
import pandas
```

Use instead:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
