Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for assignments to attributes that are not defined in `__slots__`.

## Why is this bad?

When using `__slots__`, only the specified attributes are allowed.
Attempting to assign to an attribute that is not defined in `__slots__`
will result in an `AttributeError` at runtime.

## Known problems

This rule can't detect `__slots__` implementations in superclasses, and
so limits its analysis to classes that inherit from (at most) `object`.

## Example

```python
class Student:
    __slots__ = ("name",)

    def __init__(self, name, surname):
        self.name = name
        self.surname = surname  # [assigning-non-slot]
        self.setup()

    def setup(self):
        pass
```

Use instead:

```python
class Student:
    __slots__ = ("name", "surname")

    def __init__(self, name, surname):
        self.name = name
        self.surname = surname
        self.setup()

    def setup(self):
        pass
```
