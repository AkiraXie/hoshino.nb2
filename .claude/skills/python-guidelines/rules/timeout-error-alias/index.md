Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of exceptions that alias `TimeoutError`.

## Why is this bad?

`TimeoutError` is the builtin error type used for exceptions when a system
function timed out at the system level.

In Python 3.10, `socket.timeout` was aliased to `TimeoutError`. In Python
3.11, `asyncio.TimeoutError` was aliased to `TimeoutError`.

These aliases remain in place for compatibility with older versions of
Python, but may be removed in future versions.

Prefer using `TimeoutError` directly, as it is more idiomatic and future-proof.

## Example

```python
import asyncio

raise asyncio.TimeoutError
```

Use instead:

```python
raise TimeoutError
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if it would delete any comments
within the exception expression range.
