Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for non-method functions decorated with `@singledispatchmethod`.

## Why is this bad?

The `@singledispatchmethod` decorator is intended for use with methods, not
functions.

Instead, use the `@singledispatch` decorator.

## Example

```python
from functools import singledispatchmethod

@singledispatchmethod
def func(arg): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
from functools import singledispatch

@singledispatch
def func(arg): ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as migrating from `@singledispatchmethod` to
`@singledispatch` may change the behavior of the code.
