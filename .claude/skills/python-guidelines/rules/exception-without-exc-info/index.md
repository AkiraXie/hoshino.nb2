Derived from the **[flake8-logging](../#flake8-logging-log)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `logging.exception()` with `exc_info` set to `False`.

## Why is this bad?

The `logging.exception()` method captures the exception automatically, but
accepts an optional `exc_info` argument to override this behavior. Setting
`exc_info` to `False` disables the automatic capture of the exception and
stack trace.

Instead of setting `exc_info` to `False`, prefer `logging.error()`, which
has equivalent behavior to `logging.exception()` with `exc_info` set to
`False`, but is clearer in intent.

## Example

```python
logging.exception("...", exc_info=False)
```

Use instead:

```python
logging.error("...")
```

## Options

- [`lint.logger-objects`](../../settings/#lint_logger-objects)
