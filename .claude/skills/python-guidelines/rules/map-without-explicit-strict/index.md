Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `map` calls without an explicit `strict` parameter when called with two or more
iterables, or any starred argument.

This rule applies to Python 3.14 and later, where `map` accepts a `strict` keyword
argument. For details, see: [What’s New in Python 3.14].

## Why is this bad?

By default, if the iterables passed to `map` are of different lengths, the
resulting iterator will be silently truncated to the length of the shortest
iterable. This can lead to subtle bugs.

Pass `strict=True` to raise a `ValueError` if the iterables are of
non-uniform length. Alternatively, if the iterables are deliberately of
different lengths, pass `strict=False` to make the intention explicit.

## Example

```python
map(f, a, b)
```

Use instead:

```python
map(f, a, b, strict=True)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe. While adding `strict=False` preserves
the runtime behavior, it can obscure situations where the iterables are of
unequal length. Ruff prefers to alert users so they can choose the intended
behavior themselves.
