Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `if` statements that can be replaced with `bool`.

## Why is this bad?

`if` statements that return `True` for a truthy condition and `False` for
a falsy condition can be replaced with boolean casts.

## Example

Given:

```python
def foo(x: int) -> bool:
    if x > 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(x: int) -> bool:
    return x > 0
```

Or, given:

```python
def foo(x: int) -> bool:
    if x > 0:
        return True
    return False
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(x: int) -> bool:
    return x > 0
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked as unsafe because it may change the program’s behavior if the condition does not
return a proper Boolean. While the fix will try to wrap non-boolean values in a call to bool,
custom implementations of comparison functions like `__eq__` can avoid the bool call and still
lead to altered behavior.
