Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `list()` calls around list comprehensions.

## Why is this bad?

It is redundant to use a `list()` call around a list comprehension.

## Example

```python
list([f(x) for x in foo])
```

Use instead

```python
[f(x) for x in foo]
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
