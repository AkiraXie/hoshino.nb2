Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for bare `except` catches in `try`-`except` statements.

## Why is this bad?

A bare `except` catches `BaseException` which includes
`KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`, `Exception`, and others. Catching
`BaseException` can make it hard to interrupt the program (e.g., with
Ctrl-C) and can disguise other problems.

## Example

```python
try:
    raise KeyboardInterrupt("You probably don't mean to break CTRL-C.")
except:
    print("But a bare `except` will ignore keyboard interrupts.")
```

Use instead:

```python
try:
    do_something_that_might_break()
except MoreSpecificException as e:
    handle_error(e)
```

If you actually need to catch an unknown error, use `Exception` which will
catch regular program errors but not important system exceptions.

```python
def run_a_function(some_other_fn):
    try:
        some_other_fn()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"How exceptional! {e}")
```
