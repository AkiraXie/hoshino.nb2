Derived from the **[flake8-quotes](../#flake8-quotes-q)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for docstrings that use single quotes or double quotes, depending
on the value of the [`lint.flake8-quotes.docstring-quotes`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-quotes_docstring-quotes) setting.

## Why is this bad?

Consistency is good. Use either single or double quotes for docstring
strings, but be consistent.

## Example

```python
'''
bar
'''
```

Assuming `docstring-quotes` is set to `double`, use instead:

```python
"""
bar
"""
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-quotes.docstring-quotes`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-quotes_docstring-quotes)

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter). The
formatter enforces double quotes for docstrings, making the rule
redundant.
