Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for comparisons to `None` which are not using the `is` operator.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations), "Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with
`is` or `is not`, never the equality operators."

## Example

```python
if arg != None:
    pass
if None == arg:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
if arg is not None:
    pass
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may alter runtime behavior when
used with libraries that override the `==`/`__eq__` or `!=`/`__ne__` operators.
In these cases, `is`/`is not` may not be equivalent to `==`/`!=`. For more
information, see [this issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4560).
