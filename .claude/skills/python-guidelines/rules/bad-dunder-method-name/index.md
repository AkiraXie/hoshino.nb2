Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for dunder methods that have no special meaning in Python 3.

## Why is this bad?

Misspelled or no longer supported dunder name methods may cause your code to not function
as expected.

Since dunder methods are associated with customizing the behavior
of a class in Python, introducing a dunder method such as `__foo__`
that diverges from standard Python dunder methods could potentially
confuse someone reading the code.

This rule will detect all methods starting and ending with at least
one underscore (e.g., `_str_`), but ignores known dunder methods (like
`__init__`), as well as methods that are marked with [`@override`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override).

Additional dunder methods names can be allowed via the
[`lint.pylint.allow-dunder-method-names`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_allow-dunder-method-names) setting.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    def __init_(self): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    def __init__(self): ...
```

## Options

- [`lint.pylint.allow-dunder-method-names`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_allow-dunder-method-names)
