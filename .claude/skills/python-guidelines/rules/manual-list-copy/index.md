Derived from the **[Perflint](../#perflint-perf)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `for` loops that can be replaced by a making a copy of a list.

## Why is this bad?

When creating a copy of an existing list using a for-loop, prefer
`list` or `list.copy` instead. Making a direct copy is more readable and
more performant.

Using the below as an example, the `list`-based copy is ~2x faster on
Python 3.11.

Note that, as with all `perflint` rules, this is only intended as a
micro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in
most cases.

## Example

```python
original = list(range(10000))
filtered = []
for i in original:
    filtered.append(i)
```

Use instead:

```python
original = list(range(10000))
filtered = list(original)
```
