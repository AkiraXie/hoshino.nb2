Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for lambda expressions and function definitions that can be replaced with a function from
the `operator` module.

## Why is this bad?

The `operator` module provides functions that implement the same functionality as the
corresponding operators. For example, `operator.add` is often equivalent to `lambda x, y: x + y`.
Using the functions from the `operator` module is more concise and communicates the intent of
the code more clearly.

## Example

```python
import functools

nums = [1, 2, 3]
total = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums)
```

Use instead:

```python
import functools
import operator

nums = [1, 2, 3]
total = functools.reduce(operator.add, nums)
```

## Fix safety

The fix offered by this rule is always marked as unsafe. While the changes the fix would make
would rarely break your code, there are two ways in which functions from the `operator` module
differ from user-defined functions. It would be non-trivial for Ruff to detect whether or not
these differences would matter in a specific situation where Ruff is emitting a diagnostic for
this rule.

The first difference is that `operator` functions cannot be called with keyword arguments, but
most user-defined functions can. If an `add` function is defined as `add = lambda x, y: x + y`,
replacing this function with `operator.add` will cause the later call to raise `TypeError` if
the function is later called with keyword arguments, e.g. `add(x=1, y=2)`.

The second difference is that user-defined functions are [descriptors](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html), but this is not true of
the functions defined in the `operator` module. Practically speaking, this means that defining
a function in a class body (either by using a `def` statement or assigning a `lambda` function
to a variable) is a valid way of defining an instance method on that class; monkeypatching a
user-defined function onto a class after the class has been created also has the same effect.
The same is not true of an `operator` function: assigning an `operator` function to a variable
in a class body or monkeypatching one onto a class will not create a valid instance method.
Ruff will refrain from emitting diagnostics for this rule on function definitions in class
bodies; however, it does not currently have sophisticated enough type inference to avoid
emitting this diagnostic if a user-defined function is being monkeypatched onto a class after
the class has been constructed.
