Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for conditional blocks gated on `sys.version_info` comparisons
that are outdated for the minimum supported Python version.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, code can be conditionally executed based on the active
Python version by comparing against the `sys.version_info` tuple.

If a code block is only executed for Python versions older than the
minimum supported version, it should be removed.

## Example

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info < (3, 0):
    print("py2")
else:
    print("py3")
```

Use instead:

```python
print("py3")
```

## Options

- [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version)

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because it will remove all code,
comments, and annotations within unreachable version blocks.
