Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for extraneous blank lines.

## Why is this bad?

PEP 8 recommends using blank lines as follows:

- No more than two blank lines between top-level statements.
- No more than one blank line between non-top-level statements.

## Example

```python
def func1():
    pass

def func2():
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
def func1():
    pass

def func2():
    pass
```

## Typing stub files (`.pyi`)

The rule allows at most one blank line in typing stub files in accordance to the typing style guide recommendation.

Note: The rule respects the following `isort` settings when determining the maximum number of blank lines allowed between two statements:

- [`lint.isort.lines-after-imports`](../../settings/#lint_isort_lines-after-imports): For top-level statements directly following an import statement.
- [`lint.isort.lines-between-types`](../../settings/#lint_isort_lines-between-types): For `import` statements directly following a `from ... import ...` statement or vice versa.

## Options

- [`lint.isort.lines-after-imports`](../../settings/#lint_isort_lines-after-imports)
- [`lint.isort.lines-between-types`](../../settings/#lint_isort_lines-between-types)
