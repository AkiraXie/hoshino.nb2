Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Check for unrecognized `sys.platform` checks. Platform checks should be
simple string comparisons.

**Note**: this rule is only enabled in `.pyi` stub files.

## Why is this bad?

Some `sys.platform` checks are too complex for type checkers to
understand, and thus result in incorrect inferences by these tools.
`sys.platform` checks should be simple string comparisons, like
`if sys.platform == "linux"`.

## Example

```python
import sys

if sys.platform == "xunil"[::-1]:
    # Linux specific definitions
    ...
else:
    # Posix specific definitions
    ...
```

Instead, use a simple string comparison, such as `==` or `!=`:

```python
import sys

if sys.platform == "linux":
    # Linux specific definitions
    ...
else:
    # Posix specific definitions
    ...
```
