Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `printf`-style string formatting, and offers to replace it with
`str.format` calls.

## Why is this bad?

`printf`-style string formatting has a number of quirks, and leads to less
readable code than using `str.format` calls or f-strings. In general, prefer
the newer `str.format` and f-strings constructs over `printf`-style string
formatting.

## Example

```python
"%s, %s" % ("Hello", "World")  # "Hello, World"
```

Use instead:

```python
"{}, {}".format("Hello", "World")  # "Hello, World"
```

```python
f"{'Hello'}, {'World'}"  # "Hello, World"
```

## Fix safety

In cases where the format string contains a single generic format specifier
(e.g. `%s`), and the right-hand side is an ambiguous expression,
we cannot offer a safe fix.

For example, given:

```python
"%s" % val
```

`val` could be a single-element tuple, *or* a single value (not
contained in a tuple). Both of these would resolve to the same
formatted string when using `printf`-style formatting, but
resolve differently when using f-strings:

```python
val = 1
print("%s" % val)  # "1"
print("{}".format(val))  # "1"

val = (1,)
print("%s" % val)  # "1"
print("{}".format(val))  # "(1,)"
```
