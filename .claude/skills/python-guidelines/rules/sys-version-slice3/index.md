## What it does

Checks for uses of `sys.version[:3]`.

## Why is this bad?

If the current major or minor version consists of multiple digits,
`sys.version[:3]` will truncate the version number (e.g., `"3.10"` would
become `"3.1"`). This is likely unintended, and can lead to subtle bugs if
the version string is used to test against a specific Python version.

Instead, use `sys.version_info` to access the current major and minor
version numbers as a tuple, which can be compared to other tuples
without issue.

## Example

```python
import sys

sys.version[:3]  # Evaluates to "3.1" on Python 3.10.
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

sys.version_info[:2]  # Evaluates to (3, 10) on Python 3.10.
```
