Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for membership tests using `not {element} in {collection}`.

## Why is this bad?

Testing membership with `{element} not in {collection}` is more readable.

## Example

```python
Z = not X in Y
if not X.B in Y:
    pass
```

Use instead:

```python
Z = X not in Y
if X.B not in Y:
    pass
```
