Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for function docstrings that do not include documentation for all
parameters in the function.

## Why is this bad?

This rule helps prevent you from leaving Google-style docstrings unfinished
or incomplete. Multiline Google-style docstrings should describe all
parameters for the function they are documenting.

Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by
a blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header
and a section body. Function docstrings often include a section for
function arguments; this rule is concerned with that section only.
Note that this rule only checks docstrings with an arguments (e.g. `Args`) section.

This rule is enabled when using the `google` convention, and disabled when
using the `pep257` and `numpy` conventions.

Parameters annotated with `typing.Unpack` are exempt from this rule.
This follows the Python typing specification for unpacking keyword arguments.

## Example

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises:
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```

Use instead:

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises:
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```
