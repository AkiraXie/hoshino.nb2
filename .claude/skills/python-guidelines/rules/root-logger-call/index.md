Derived from the **[flake8-logging](../#flake8-logging-log)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for usages of the following `logging` top-level functions:
`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`, `log`, `exception`.

## Why is this bad?

Using the root logger causes the messages to have no source information,
making them less useful for debugging.

## Example

```python
import logging

logging.info("Foobar")
```

Use instead:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Foobar")
```
