Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for f-strings that do not contain any placeholder expressions.

## Why is this bad?

f-strings are a convenient way to format strings, but they are not
necessary if there are no placeholder expressions to format. In this
case, a regular string should be used instead, as an f-string without
placeholders can be confusing for readers, who may expect such a
placeholder to be present.

An f-string without any placeholders could also indicate that the
author forgot to add a placeholder expression.

## Example

```python
f"Hello, world!"
```

Use instead:

```python
"Hello, world!"
```

**Note:** to maintain compatibility with PyFlakes, this rule only flags
f-strings that are part of an implicit concatenation if *none* of the
f-string segments contain placeholder expressions.

For example:

```python
# Will not be flagged.
(
    f"Hello,"
    f" {name}!"
)

# Will be flagged.
(
    f"Hello,"
    f" World!"
)
```
