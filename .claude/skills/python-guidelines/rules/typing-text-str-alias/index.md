Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `typing.Text`.

In preview mode, also checks for `typing_extensions.Text`.

## Why is this bad?

`typing.Text` is an alias for `str`, and only exists for Python 2
compatibility. As of Python 3.11, `typing.Text` is deprecated. Use `str`
instead.

## Example

```python
from typing import Text

foo: Text = "bar"
```

Use instead:

```python
foo: str = "bar"
```
