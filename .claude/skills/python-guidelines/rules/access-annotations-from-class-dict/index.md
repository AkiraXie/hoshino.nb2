This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `foo.__dict__.get("__annotations__")` or
`foo.__dict__["__annotations__"]` on Python 3.10+ and Python < 3.10 when
[typing-extensions](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_typing-extensions)
is enabled.

## Why is this bad?

Starting with Python 3.14, directly accessing `__annotations__` via
`foo.__dict__.get("__annotations__")` or `foo.__dict__["__annotations__"]`
will only return annotations if the class is defined under
`from __future__ import annotations`.

Therefore, it is better to use dedicated library functions like
`annotationlib.get_annotations` (Python 3.14+), `inspect.get_annotations`
(Python 3.10+), or `typing_extensions.get_annotations` (for Python < 3.10 if
[typing-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/) is
available).

The benefits of using these functions include:

1. **Avoiding Undocumented Internals:** They provide a stable, public API,
   unlike direct `__dict__` access which relies on implementation details.
2. **Forward-Compatibility:** They are designed to handle changes in
   Python's annotation system across versions, ensuring your code remains
   robust (e.g., correctly handling the Python 3.14 behavior mentioned
   above).

See [Python Annotations Best Practices](https://docs.python.org/3.14/howto/annotations.html)
for alternatives.

## Example

```python
foo.__dict__.get("__annotations__", {})
# or
foo.__dict__["__annotations__"]
```

On Python 3.14+, use instead:

```python
import annotationlib

annotationlib.get_annotations(foo)
```

On Python 3.10+, use instead:

```python
import inspect

inspect.get_annotations(foo)
```

On Python < 3.10 with [typing-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/)
installed, use instead:

```python
import typing_extensions

typing_extensions.get_annotations(foo)
```
