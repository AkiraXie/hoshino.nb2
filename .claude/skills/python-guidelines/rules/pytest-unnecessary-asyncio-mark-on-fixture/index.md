Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators applied to fixtures.

## Why is this bad?

`pytest.mark.asyncio` is unnecessary for fixtures.

## Example

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio()
@pytest.fixture()
async def my_fixture():
    return 0
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture()
async def my_fixture():
    return 0
```
