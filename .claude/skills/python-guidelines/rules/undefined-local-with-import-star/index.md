Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of wildcard imports.

## Why is this bad?

Wildcard imports (e.g., `from module import *`) make it hard to determine
which symbols are available in the current namespace, and from which module
they were imported. They're also discouraged by [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports).

## Example

```python
from math import *

def area(radius):
    return pi * radius**2
```

Use instead:

```python
from math import pi

def area(radius):
    return pi * radius**2
```
