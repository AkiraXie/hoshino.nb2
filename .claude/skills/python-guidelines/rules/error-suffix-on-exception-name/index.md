Derived from the **[pep8-naming](../#pep8-naming-n)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for custom exception definitions that omit the `Error` suffix.

## Why is this bad?

The `Error` suffix is recommended by [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#exception-names):

> Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention
> applies here. However, you should use the suffix `"Error"` on your
> exception names (if the exception actually is an error).

## Example

```python
class Validation(Exception): ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class ValidationError(Exception): ...
```

## Options

- [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names)
- [`lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names`](../../settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names)
