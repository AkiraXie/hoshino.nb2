Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `list()` calls that take unnecessary list or tuple literals as
arguments.

## Why is this bad?

It's unnecessary to use a list or tuple literal within a `list()` call,
since there is a literal syntax for these types.

If a list literal is passed in, then the outer call to `list()` should be
removed. Otherwise, if a tuple literal is passed in, then it should be
rewritten as a list literal.

## Example

```python
list([1, 2])
list((1, 2))
```

Use instead:

```python
[1, 2]
[1, 2]
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments
when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.
