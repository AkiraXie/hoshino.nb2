Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for function calls with parameters that indicate the use of insecure
SSL and TLS protocol versions.

## Why is this bad?

Several highly publicized exploitable flaws have been discovered in all
versions of SSL and early versions of TLS. The following versions are
considered insecure, and should be avoided:

- SSL v2
- SSL v3
- TLS v1
- TLS v1.1

This method supports detection on the Python's built-in `ssl` module and
the `pyOpenSSL` module.

## Example

```python
import ssl

ssl.wrap_socket(ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)
```

Use instead:

```python
import ssl

ssl.wrap_socket(ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
```
