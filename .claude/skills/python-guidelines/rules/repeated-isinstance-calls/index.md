Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

**Warning: This rule has been removed and its documentation is only available for historical reasons.**

Fix is always available.

## Removed

This rule is identical to [SIM101](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/duplicate-isinstance-call/) which should be used instead.

## What it does

Checks for repeated `isinstance` calls on the same object.

## Why is this bad?

Repeated `isinstance` calls on the same object can be merged into a
single call.

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe on Python 3.10 and later, as combining
multiple `isinstance` calls with a binary operator (`|`) will fail at
runtime if any of the operands are themselves tuples.

For example, given `TYPES = (dict, list)`, then
`isinstance(None, TYPES | set | float)` will raise a `TypeError` at runtime,
while `isinstance(None, set | float)` will not.

## Example

```python
def is_number(x):
    return isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float) or isinstance(x, complex)
```

Use instead:

```python
def is_number(x):
    return isinstance(x, (int, float, complex))
```

Or, for Python 3.10 and later:

```python
def is_number(x):
    return isinstance(x, int | float | complex)
```
