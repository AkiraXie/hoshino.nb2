Derived from the **[flake8-builtins](../#flake8-builtins-a)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for imports that use the same names as builtins.

## Why is this bad?

Reusing a builtin for the name of an import increases the difficulty
of reading and maintaining the code, and can cause non-obvious errors,
as readers may mistake the variable for the builtin and vice versa.

Builtins can be marked as exceptions to this rule via the
[`lint.flake8-builtins.ignorelist`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_ignorelist) configuration option.

## Example

```python
from rich import print

print("Some message")
```

Use instead:

```python
from rich import print as rich_print

rich_print("Some message")
```

or:

```python
import rich

rich.print("Some message")
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-builtins.ignorelist`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_ignorelist)
- [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version)
