Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `for` loops that can be replaced with `yield from` expressions.

## Why is this bad?

If a `for` loop only contains a `yield` statement, it can be replaced with a
`yield from` expression, which is more concise and idiomatic.

## Example

```python
def bar():
    for x in foo:
        yield x

    global y
    for y in foo:
        yield y
```

Use instead:

```python
def bar():
    yield from foo

    for _element in foo:
        y = _element
        yield y
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as converting a `for` loop to a `yield from` expression can change the behavior of the program in rare cases.
For example, if a generator is being sent values via `send`, then rewriting
to a `yield from` could lead to an attribute error if the underlying
generator does not implement the `send` method.

Additionally, if at least one target is `global` or `nonlocal`,
no fix will be offered.

In most cases, however, the fix is safe, and such a modification should have
no effect on the behavior of the program.
