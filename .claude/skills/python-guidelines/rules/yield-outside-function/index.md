Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `yield`, `yield from`, and `await` usages outside of functions.

## Why is this bad?

The use of `yield`, `yield from`, or `await` outside of a function will
raise a `SyntaxError`.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    yield 1
```

## Notebook behavior

As an exception, `await` is allowed at the top level of a Jupyter notebook
(see: [autoawait](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/autoawait.html)).
