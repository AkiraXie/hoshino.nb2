Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for type alias definitions that are not annotated with
`typing.TypeAlias`.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, a type alias is defined by assigning a type to a variable (e.g.,
`Vector = list[float]`).

It's best to annotate type aliases with the `typing.TypeAlias` type to
make it clear that the statement is a type alias declaration, as opposed
to a normal variable assignment.

## Example

```python
Vector = list[float]
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

Vector: TypeAlias = list[float]
```

## Availability

Because this rule relies on the third-party `typing_extensions` module for Python versions
before 3.10, its diagnostic will not be emitted, and no fix will be offered, if
`typing_extensions` imports have been disabled by the [`lint.typing-extensions`](../../settings/#lint_typing-extensions) linter option.

## Options

- [`lint.typing-extensions`](../../settings/#lint_typing-extensions)
