Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for the use of shorthand aliases for regular expression flags
(e.g., `re.I` instead of `re.IGNORECASE`).

## Why is this bad?

The regular expression module provides descriptive names for each flag,
along with single-letter aliases. Prefer the descriptive names, as they
are more readable and self-documenting.

## Example

```python
import re

if re.search("^hello", "hello world", re.I):
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
import re

if re.search("^hello", "hello world", re.IGNORECASE):
    ...
```
