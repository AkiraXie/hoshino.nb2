Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `else` clauses on loops without a `break` statement.

## Why is this bad?

When a loop includes an `else` statement, the code inside the `else` clause
will be executed if the loop terminates "normally" (i.e., without a
`break`).

If a loop *always* terminates "normally" (i.e., does *not* contain a
`break`), then the `else` clause is redundant, as the code inside the
`else` clause will always be executed.

In such cases, the code inside the `else` clause can be moved outside the
loop entirely, and the `else` clause can be removed.

## Example

```python
for item in items:
    print(item)
else:
    print("All items printed")
```

Use instead:

```python
for item in items:
    print(item)
print("All items printed")
```
