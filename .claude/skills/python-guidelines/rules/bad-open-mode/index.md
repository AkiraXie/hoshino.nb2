Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Check for an invalid `mode` argument in `open` calls.

## Why is this bad?

The `open` function accepts a `mode` argument that specifies how the file
should be opened (e.g., read-only, write-only, append-only, etc.).

Python supports a variety of open modes: `r`, `w`, `a`, and `x`, to control
reading, writing, appending, and creating, respectively, along with
`b` (binary mode), `+` (read and write), and `U` (universal newlines),
the latter of which is only valid alongside `r`. This rule detects both
invalid combinations of modes and invalid characters in the mode string
itself.

## Example

```python
with open("file", "rwx") as f:
    content = f.read()
```

Use instead:

```python
with open("file", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
```
