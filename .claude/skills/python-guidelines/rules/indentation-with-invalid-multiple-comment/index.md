Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for indentation of comments with a non-multiple of 4 spaces.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#indentation), 4 spaces per indentation level should be preferred.

## Example

```python
if True:
   # a = 1
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
if True:
    # a = 1
    ...
```

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/). The
formatter enforces consistent indentation, making the rule redundant.

The rule is also incompatible with the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) when using
`indent-width` with a value other than `4`.

## Options

- [`indent-width`](../../settings/#indent-width)
