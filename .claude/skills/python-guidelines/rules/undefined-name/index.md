Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of undefined names.

## Why is this bad?

An undefined name is likely to raise `NameError` at runtime.

## Example

```python
def double():
    return n * 2  # raises `NameError` if `n` is undefined when `double` is called
```

Use instead:

```python
def double(n):
    return n * 2
```

## Options

- [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version): Can be used to configure which symbols Ruff will understand
  as being available in the `builtins` namespace.
