Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for strings that contain the raw control character `NUL` (0 byte).

## Why is this bad?

Control characters are displayed differently by different text editors and
terminals.

By using the `\0` sequence in lieu of the `NUL` control character, the
string will contain the same value, but will render visibly in all editors.

## Example

```python
x = ""
```

Use instead:

```python
x = "\0"
```
