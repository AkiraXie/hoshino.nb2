Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for invalid assignments to `__all__`.

## Why is this bad?

In Python, `__all__` should contain a sequence of strings that represent
the names of all "public" symbols exported by a module.

Assigning anything other than a `tuple` or `list` of strings to `__all__`
is invalid.

## Example

```python
__all__ = "Foo"
```

Use instead:

```python
__all__ = ("Foo",)
```
