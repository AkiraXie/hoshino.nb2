Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `if` expressions that can be replaced with `bool()` calls.

## Why is this bad?

`if` expressions that evaluate to `True` for a truthy condition an `False`
for a falsey condition can be replaced with `bool()` calls, which are more
concise and readable.

## Example

```python
True if a else False
```

Use instead:

```python
bool(a)
```

## Fix safety

This fix is marked as unsafe because it may change the program’s behavior if the condition does not
return a proper Boolean. While the fix will try to wrap non-boolean values in a call to bool,
custom implementations of comparison functions like `__eq__` can avoid the bool call and still
lead to altered behavior. Moreover, the fix may remove comments.
