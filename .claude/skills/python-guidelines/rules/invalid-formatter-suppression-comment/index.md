Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for formatter suppression comments that are ineffective or incompatible
with Ruff's formatter.

## Why is this bad?

Suppression comments that do not actually prevent formatting could cause unintended changes
when the formatter is run.

## Example

In the following example, all suppression comments would cause
a rule violation.

```python
def decorator():
    pass

@decorator
# fmt: off
def example():
    if True:
        # fmt: skip
        expression = [
            # fmt: off
            1,
            2,
        ]
        # yapf: disable
    # fmt: on
    # yapf: enable
```

## Fix safety

This fix is always marked as unsafe because it deletes the invalid suppression comment,
rather than trying to move it to a valid position, which the user more likely intended.
