Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for multi-line docstrings whose closing quotes are not on their
own line.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) recommends that the closing quotes of a multi-line docstring be
on their own line, for consistency and compatibility with documentation
tools that may need to parse the docstring.

## Example

```python
def sort_list(l: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Return a sorted copy of the list.

    Sort the list in ascending order and return a copy of the result using the
    bubble sort algorithm."""
```

Use instead:

```python
def sort_list(l: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Return a sorted copy of the list.

    Sort the list in ascending order and return a copy of the result using the bubble
    sort algorithm.
    """
```
