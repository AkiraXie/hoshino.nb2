Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary list or set comprehensions passed to builtin functions that take an iterable.

Set comprehensions are only a violation in the case where the builtin function does not care about
duplication of elements in the passed iterable.

## Why is this bad?

Many builtin functions (this rule currently covers `any` and `all` in stable, along with `min`,
`max`, and `sum` in [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/)) accept any iterable, including a generator. Constructing a
temporary list via list comprehension is unnecessary and wastes memory for large iterables.

`any` and `all` can also short-circuit iteration, saving a lot of time. The unnecessary
comprehension forces a full iteration of the input iterable, giving up the benefits of
short-circuiting. For example, compare the performance of `all` with a list comprehension
against that of a generator in a case where an early short-circuit is possible (almost 40x
faster):

```python
In [1]: %timeit all([i for i in range(1000)])
8.14 µs ± 25.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)

In [2]: %timeit all(i for i in range(1000))
212 ns ± 0.892 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
```

This performance improvement is due to short-circuiting. If the entire iterable has to be
traversed, the comprehension version may even be a bit faster: list allocation overhead is not
necessarily greater than generator overhead.

Applying this rule simplifies the code and will usually save memory, but in the absence of
short-circuiting it may not improve performance. (It may even slightly regress performance,
though the difference will usually be small.)

## Example

```python
any([x.id for x in bar])
all([x.id for x in bar])
sum([x.val for x in bar])
min([x.val for x in bar])
max([x.val for x in bar])
```

Use instead:

```python
any(x.id for x in bar)
all(x.id for x in bar)
sum(x.val for x in bar)
min(x.val for x in bar)
max(x.val for x in bar)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it can change the behavior of the code if the iteration
has side effects (due to laziness and short-circuiting). The fix may also drop comments when
rewriting some comprehensions.
