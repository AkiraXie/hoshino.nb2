Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for extraneous whitespace after an operator.

## Why is this bad?

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements), operators should be surrounded by at most a single space on either
side.

## Example

```python
a = 4 +  5
```

Use instead:

```python
a = 4 + 5
```
