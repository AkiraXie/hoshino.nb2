Derived from the **[flake8-commas](../#flake8-commas-com)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of trailing commas on bare (i.e., unparenthesized)
tuples.

## Why is this bad?

The presence of a misplaced comma will cause Python to interpret the value
as a tuple, which can lead to unexpected behaviour.

## Example

```python
import json

foo = json.dumps({"bar": 1}),
```

Use instead:

```python
import json

foo = json.dumps({"bar": 1})
```

In the event that a tuple is intended, then use instead:

```python
import json

foo = (json.dumps({"bar": 1}),)
```
