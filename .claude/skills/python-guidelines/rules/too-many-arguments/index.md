Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for function definitions that include too many arguments.

By default, this rule allows up to five arguments, as configured by the
[`lint.pylint.max-args`](../../settings/#lint_pylint_max-args) option.

This rule exempts methods decorated with [`@typing.override`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.override).
Changing the signature of a subclass method may cause type checkers to
complain about a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle if it
means that the method now incompatibly overrides a method defined on a
superclass. Explicitly decorating an overriding method with `@override`
signals to Ruff that the method is intended to override a superclass
method and that a type checker will enforce that it does so; Ruff
therefore knows that it should not enforce rules about methods having
too many arguments.

## Why is this bad?

Functions with many arguments are harder to understand, maintain, and call.
Consider refactoring functions with many arguments into smaller functions
with fewer arguments, or using objects to group related arguments.

## Example

```python
def calculate_position(x_pos, y_pos, z_pos, x_vel, y_vel, z_vel, time):
    new_x = x_pos + x_vel * time
    new_y = y_pos + y_vel * time
    new_z = z_pos + z_vel * time
    return new_x, new_y, new_z
```

Use instead:

```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Vector(NamedTuple):
    x: float
    y: float
    z: float

def calculate_position(pos: Vector, vel: Vector, time: float) -> Vector:
    return Vector(*(p + v * time for p, v in zip(pos, vel)))
```

## Options
