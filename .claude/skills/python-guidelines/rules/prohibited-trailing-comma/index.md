Derived from the **[flake8-commas](../#flake8-commas-com)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of prohibited trailing commas.

## Why is this bad?

Trailing commas are not essential in some cases and can therefore be viewed
as unnecessary.

## Example

```python
foo = (1, 2, 3,)
```

Use instead:

```python
foo = (1, 2, 3)
```

## Formatter compatibility

We recommend against using this rule alongside the [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/). The
formatter enforces consistent use of trailing commas, making the rule redundant.
