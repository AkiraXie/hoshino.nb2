Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for missing whitespace around bitwise and shift operators.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations) recommends never using more than one space, and always having the
same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator.

For consistency, this rule enforces one space before and after bitwise and
shift operators (`<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`).

(Note that [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations) suggests only adding whitespace around the operator with
the lowest precedence, but that authors should "use [their] own judgment".)

## Example

```python
x = 128<<1
```

Use instead:

```python
x = 128 << 1
```
