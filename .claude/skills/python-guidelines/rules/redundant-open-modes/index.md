Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for redundant `open` mode arguments.

## Why is this bad?

Redundant `open` mode arguments are unnecessary and should be removed to
avoid confusion.

## Example

```python
with open("foo.txt", "r") as f:
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
with open("foo.txt") as f:
    ...
```
