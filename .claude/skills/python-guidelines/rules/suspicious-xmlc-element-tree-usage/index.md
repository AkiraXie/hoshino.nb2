## What it does

Checks for uses of insecure XML parsers.

## Why is this bad?

Many XML parsers are vulnerable to XML attacks (such as entity expansion),
which cause excessive memory and CPU usage by exploiting recursion. An
attacker could use such methods to access unauthorized resources.

Consider using the `defusedxml` package when parsing untrusted XML data,
to protect against XML attacks.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to insecure XML parsers.

## Example

```python
from xml.etree.cElementTree import parse

tree = parse("untrusted.xml")  # Vulnerable to XML attacks.
```

Use instead:

```python
from defusedxml.cElementTree import parse

tree = parse("untrusted.xml")
```
