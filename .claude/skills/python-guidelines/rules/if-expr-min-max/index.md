Derived from the **[refurb](../#refurb-furb)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `if` expressions that can be replaced with `min()` or `max()`
calls.

## Why is this bad?

An `if` expression that selects the lesser or greater of two
sub-expressions can be replaced with a `min()` or `max()` call
respectively. When possible, prefer `min()` and `max()`, as they're more
concise and readable than the equivalent `if` expression.

## Example

```python
score1, score2 = 4, 5

highest_score = score1 if score1 > score2 else score2
```

Use instead:

```python
score1, score2 = 4, 5

highest_score = max(score2, score1)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.
