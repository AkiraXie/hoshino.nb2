Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for equality comparisons to boolean literals.

## Why is this bad?

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations) recommends against using the equality operators `==` and `!=` to
compare values to `True` or `False`.

Instead, use `if cond:` or `if not cond:` to check for truth values.

If you intend to check if a value is the boolean literal `True` or `False`,
consider using `is` or `is not` to check for identity instead.

## Example

```python
if foo == True:
    ...

if bar == False:
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
if foo:
    ...

if not bar:
    ...
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may alter runtime behavior when
used with libraries that override the `==`/`__eq__` or `!=`/`__ne__` operators.
In these cases, `is`/`is not` may not be equivalent to `==`/`!=`. For more
information, see [this issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4560).
