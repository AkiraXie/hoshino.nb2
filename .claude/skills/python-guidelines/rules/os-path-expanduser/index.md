Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `os.path.expanduser`.

## Why is this bad?

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to
the lower-level API offered by `os.path`. When possible, using `Path` object
methods such as `Path.expanduser()` can improve readability over the `os.path`
module's counterparts (e.g., as `os.path.expanduser()`).

## Examples

```python
import os

os.path.expanduser("~/films/Monty Python")
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

Path("~/films/Monty Python").expanduser()
```

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.

## Fix Safety

This rule's fix is always marked as unsafe because the behaviors of
`os.path.expanduser` and `Path.expanduser` differ when a user's home
directory can't be resolved: `os.path.expanduser` returns the
input unchanged, while `Path.expanduser` raises `RuntimeError`.

Additionally, the fix is marked as unsafe because `os.path.expanduser()` returns `str` or `bytes` (`AnyStr`),
while `Path.expanduser()` returns a `Path` object. This change in return type can break code that uses
the return value.
