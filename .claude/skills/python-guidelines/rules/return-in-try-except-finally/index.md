Derived from the **[flake8-simplify](../#flake8-simplify-sim)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for `return` statements in `try`-`except` and `finally` blocks.

## Why is this bad?

The `return` statement in a `finally` block will always be executed, even if
an exception is raised in the `try` or `except` block. This can lead to
unexpected behavior.

## Example

```python
def squared(n):
    try:
        sqr = n**2
        return sqr
    except Exception:
        return "An exception occurred"
    finally:
        return -1  # Always returns -1.
```

Use instead:

```python
def squared(n):
    try:
        return_value = n**2
    except Exception:
        return_value = "An exception occurred"
    finally:
        return_value = -1
    return return_value
```
