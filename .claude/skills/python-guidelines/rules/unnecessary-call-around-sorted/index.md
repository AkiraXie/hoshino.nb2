Derived from the **[flake8-comprehensions](../#flake8-comprehensions-c4)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for unnecessary `list()` or `reversed()` calls around `sorted()`
calls.

## Why is this bad?

It is unnecessary to use `list()` around `sorted()`, as the latter already
returns a list.

It is also unnecessary to use `reversed()` around `sorted()`, as the latter
has a `reverse` argument that can be used in lieu of an additional
`reversed()` call.

In both cases, it's clearer and more efficient to avoid the redundant call.

## Example

```python
reversed(sorted(iterable))
```

Use instead:

```python
sorted(iterable, reverse=True)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe for `reversed()` cases, as `reversed()`
and `reverse=True` will yield different results in the event of custom sort
keys or equality functions. Specifically, `reversed()` will reverse the order
of the collection, while `sorted()` with `reverse=True` will perform a stable
reverse sort, which will preserve the order of elements that compare as
equal.

The fix is marked as safe for `list()` cases, as removing `list()` around
`sorted()` does not change the behavior.
