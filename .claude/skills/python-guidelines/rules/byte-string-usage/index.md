Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `typing.ByteString` or `collections.abc.ByteString`.

## Why is this bad?

`ByteString` has been deprecated since Python 3.9 and will be removed in
Python 3.17. The Python documentation recommends using either
`collections.abc.Buffer` (or the `typing_extensions` backport
on Python \<3.12) or a union like `bytes | bytearray | memoryview` instead.

## Example

```python
from typing import ByteString
```

Use instead:

```python
from collections.abc import Buffer
```
