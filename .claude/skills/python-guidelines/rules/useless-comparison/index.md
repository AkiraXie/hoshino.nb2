## What it does

Checks for useless comparisons.

## Why is this bad?

Useless comparisons have no effect on the program, and are often included
by mistake. If the comparison is intended to enforce an invariant, prepend
the comparison with an `assert`. Otherwise, remove it entirely.

## Example

```python
foo == bar
```

Use instead:

```python
assert foo == bar, "`foo` and `bar` should be equal."
```

## Notebook behavior

For Jupyter Notebooks, this rule is not applied to the last top-level expression in a cell.
This is because it's common to have a notebook cell that ends with an expression,
which will result in the `repr` of the evaluated expression being printed as the cell's output.
