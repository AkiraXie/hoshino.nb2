Derived from the **[flake8-pytest-style](../#flake8-pytest-style-pt)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for incorrect import of pytest.

## Why is this bad?

For consistency, `pytest` should be imported as `import pytest` and its members should be
accessed in the form of `pytest.xxx.yyy` for consistency

## Example

```python
import pytest as pt
from pytest import fixture
```

Use instead:

```python
import pytest
```
