Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for trailing whitespace after a decorator's opening `@`.

## Why is this bad?

Including whitespace after the `@` symbol is not compliant with
[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length).

## Example

```python
@ decorator
def func():
   pass
```

Use instead:

```python
@decorator
def func():
  pass
```
