Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `type` that take a primitive as an argument.

## Why is this bad?

`type()` returns the type of a given object. A type of a primitive can
always be known in advance and accessed directly, which is more concise
and explicit than using `type()`.

## Example

```python
type(1)
```

Use instead:

```python
int
```
