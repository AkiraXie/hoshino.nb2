Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Checks for unexpected indentation of comment.

## Why is this bad?

Comments should match the indentation of the containing code block.

## Example

```python
a = 1
    # b = 2
```

Use instead:

```python
a = 1
# b = 2
```
