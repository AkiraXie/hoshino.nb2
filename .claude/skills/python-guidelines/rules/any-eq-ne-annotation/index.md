Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for `__eq__` and `__ne__` implementations that use `typing.Any` as
the type annotation for their second parameter.

## Why is this bad?

The Python documentation recommends the use of `object` to "indicate that a
value could be any type in a typesafe manner". `Any`, on the other hand,
should be seen as an "escape hatch when you need to mix dynamically and
statically typed code". Since using `Any` allows you to write highly unsafe
code, you should generally only use `Any` when the semantics of your code
would otherwise be inexpressible to the type checker.

The expectation in Python is that a comparison of two arbitrary objects
using `==` or `!=` should never raise an exception. This contract can be
fully expressed in the type system and does not involve requesting unsound
behaviour from a type checker. As such, `object` is a more appropriate
annotation than `Any` for the second parameter of the methods implementing
these comparison operators -- `__eq__` and `__ne__`.

## Example

```python
from typing import Any

class Foo:
    def __eq__(self, obj: Any) -> bool: ...
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    def __eq__(self, obj: object) -> bool: ...
```
