Derived from the **[flake8-return](../#flake8-return-ret)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for `else` statements with a `continue` statement in the preceding
`if` block.

## Why is this bad?

The `else` statement is not needed, as the `continue` statement will always
continue onto the next iteration of a loop. Removing the `else` will reduce
nesting and make the code more readable.

## Example

```python
def foo(bar, baz):
    for i in bar:
        if i < baz:
            continue
        else:
            x = 0
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo(bar, baz):
    for i in bar:
        if i < baz:
            continue
        x = 0
```
