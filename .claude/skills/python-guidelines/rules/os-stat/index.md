Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `os.stat`.

## Why is this bad?

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to
the lower-level API offered by `os`. When possible, using `Path` object
methods such as `Path.stat()` can improve readability over the `os`
module's counterparts (e.g., `os.path.stat()`).

## Examples

```python
import os
from pwd import getpwuid
from grp import getgrgid

stat = os.stat(file_name)
owner_name = getpwuid(stat.st_uid).pw_name
group_name = getgrgid(stat.st_gid).gr_name
```

Use instead:

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path(file_name)
stat = file_path.stat()
owner_name = file_path.owner()
group_name = file_path.group()
```

## Known issues

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.
