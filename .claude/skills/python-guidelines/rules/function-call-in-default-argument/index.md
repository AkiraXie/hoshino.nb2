Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for function calls in default function arguments.

## Why is this bad?

Any function call that's used in a default argument will only be performed
once, at definition time. The returned value will then be reused by all
calls to the function, which can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Parameters with immutable type annotations will be ignored by this rule.
Those whose default arguments are `NewType` calls where the original type
is immutable are also ignored.

Calls and types outside of the standard library can be marked as an exception
to this rule with the [`lint.flake8-bugbear.extend-immutable-calls`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-bugbear_extend-immutable-calls) configuration option.

## Example

```python
def create_list() -> list[int]:
    return [1, 2, 3]

def mutable_default(arg: list[int] = create_list()) -> list[int]:
    arg.append(4)
    return arg
```

Use instead:

```python
def better(arg: list[int] | None = None) -> list[int]:
    if arg is None:
        arg = create_list()

    arg.append(4)
    return arg
```

If the use of a singleton is intentional, assign the result call to a
module-level variable, and use that variable in the default argument:

```python
ERROR = ValueError("Hosts weren't successfully added")

def add_host(error: Exception = ERROR) -> None: ...
```

## Options

- [`lint.flake8-bugbear.extend-immutable-calls`](../../settings/#lint_flake8-bugbear_extend-immutable-calls)
