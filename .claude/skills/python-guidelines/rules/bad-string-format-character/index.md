Derived from the **[Pylint](../#pylint-pl)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for unsupported format types in format strings.

## Why is this bad?

An invalid format string character will result in an error at runtime.

## Example

```python
# `z` is not a valid format type.
print("%z" % "1")

print("{:z}".format("1"))
```
