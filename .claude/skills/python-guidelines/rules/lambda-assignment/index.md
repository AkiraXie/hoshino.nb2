Derived from the **[pycodestyle](../#pycodestyle-e-w)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for lambda expressions which are assigned to a variable.

## Why is this bad?

Per PEP 8, you should "Always use a def statement instead of an assignment
statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier."

Using a `def` statement leads to better tracebacks, and the assignment
itself negates the primary benefit of using a `lambda` expression (i.e.,
that it can be embedded inside another expression).

## Example

```python
f = lambda x: 2 * x
```

Use instead:

```python
def f(x):
    return 2 * x
```
