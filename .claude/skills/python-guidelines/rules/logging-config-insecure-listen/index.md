Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for insecure `logging.config.listen` calls.

## Why is this bad?

`logging.config.listen` starts a server that listens for logging
configuration requests. This is insecure, as parts of the configuration are
passed to the built-in `eval` function, which can be used to execute
arbitrary code.

## Example

```python
import logging

logging.config.listen(9999)
```
