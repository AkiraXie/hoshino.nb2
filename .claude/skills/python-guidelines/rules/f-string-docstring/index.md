Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for docstrings that are written via f-strings.

## Why is this bad?

Python will interpret the f-string as a joined string, rather than as a
docstring. As such, the "docstring" will not be accessible via the
`__doc__` attribute, nor will it be picked up by any automated
documentation tooling.

## Example

```python
def foo():
    f"""Not a docstring."""
```

Use instead:

```python
def foo():
    """A docstring."""
```
