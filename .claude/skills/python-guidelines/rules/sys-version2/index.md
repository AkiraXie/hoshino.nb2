## What it does

Checks for uses of `sys.version[2]`.

## Why is this bad?

If the current major or minor version consists of multiple digits,
`sys.version[2]` will select the first digit of the minor number only
(e.g., `"3.10"` would evaluate to `"1"`). This is likely unintended, and
can lead to subtle bugs if the version is used to test against a minor
version number.

Instead, use `sys.version_info.minor` to access the current minor version
number.

## Example

```python
import sys

sys.version[2]  # Evaluates to "1" on Python 3.10.
```

Use instead:

```python
import sys

f"{sys.version_info.minor}"  # Evaluates to "10" on Python 3.10.
```
