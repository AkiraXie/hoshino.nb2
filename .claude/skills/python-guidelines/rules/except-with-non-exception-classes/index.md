Derived from the **[flake8-bugbear](../#flake8-bugbear-b)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for exception handlers that catch non-exception classes.

## Why is this bad?

Catching classes that do not inherit from `BaseException` will raise a
`TypeError`.

## Example

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except 1:
    ...
```

Use instead:

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    ...
```
