Derived from the **[Pyflakes](../#pyflakes-f)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the use of too many expressions in starred assignment statements.

## Why is this bad?

In assignment statements, starred expressions can be used to unpack iterables.

In Python 3, no more than `1 << 8` assignments are allowed before a starred
expression, and no more than `1 << 24` expressions are allowed after a starred
expression.
