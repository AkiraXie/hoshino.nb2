Derived from the **[isort](../#isort-i)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Adds any required imports, as specified by the user, to the top of the
file.

## Why is this bad?

In some projects, certain imports are required to be present in all
files. For example, some projects assume that
`from __future__ import annotations` is enabled,
and thus require that import to be
present in all files. Omitting a "required" import (as specified by
the user) can cause errors or unexpected behavior.

## Example

```python
import typing
```

Use instead:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import typing
```

## Options

- [`lint.isort.required-imports`](../../settings/#lint_isort_required-imports)
