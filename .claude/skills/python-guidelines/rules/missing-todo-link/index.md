Derived from the **[flake8-todos](../#flake8-todos-td)** linter.

## What it does

Checks that a TODO comment is associated with a link to a relevant issue
or ticket.

## Why is this bad?

Including an issue link near a TODO makes it easier for resolvers
to get context around the issue.

## Example

```python
# TODO: this link has no issue
```

Use one of these instead:

```python
# TODO(charlie): this comment has an issue link
# https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3870

# TODO(charlie): this comment has a 3-digit issue code
# 003

# TODO(charlie): https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3870
# this comment has an issue link

# TODO(charlie): #003 this comment has a 3-digit issue code
# with leading character `#`

# TODO(charlie): this comment has an issue code (matches the regex `[A-Z]+\-?\d+`)
# SIXCHR-003
```
