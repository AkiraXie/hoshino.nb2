Fix is always available.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## What it does

Searches for strings that look like they were meant to be f-strings, but are missing an `f` prefix.

## Why is this bad?

Expressions inside curly braces are only evaluated if the string has an `f` prefix.

## Details

There are many possible string literals which are not meant to be f-strings
despite containing f-string-like syntax. As such, this lint ignores all strings
where one of the following conditions applies:

1. The string is a standalone expression. For example, the rule ignores all docstrings.
2. The string is part of a function call with argument names that match at least one variable
   (for example: `format("Message: {value}", value="Hello World")`)
3. The string (or a parent expression of the string) has a direct method call on it
   (for example: `"{value}".format(...)`)
4. The string has no `{...}` expression sections, or uses invalid f-string syntax.
5. The string references variables that are not in scope, or it doesn't capture variables at all.
6. Any format specifiers in the potential f-string are invalid.
7. The string is part of a function call that is known to expect a template string rather than an
   evaluated f-string: for example, a [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#using-particular-formatting-styles-throughout-your-application) call, a [`gettext`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html) call,
   or a [FastAPI path](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params/).

## Example

```python
name = "Sarah"
day_of_week = "Tuesday"
print("Hello {name}! It is {day_of_week} today!")
```

Use instead:

```python
name = "Sarah"
day_of_week = "Tuesday"
print(f"Hello {name}! It is {day_of_week} today!")
```

## Fix safety

This fix will always change the behavior of the program and, despite the precautions detailed
above, this may be undesired. As such the fix is always marked as unsafe.
