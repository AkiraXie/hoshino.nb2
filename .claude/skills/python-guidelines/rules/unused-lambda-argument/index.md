Derived from the **[flake8-unused-arguments](../#flake8-unused-arguments-arg)** linter.

## What it does

Checks for the presence of unused arguments in lambda expression
definitions.

## Why is this bad?

An argument that is defined but not used is likely a mistake, and should
be removed to avoid confusion.

If a variable is intentionally defined-but-not-used, it should be
prefixed with an underscore, or some other value that adheres to the
[`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx) pattern.

## Example

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = map(lambda x, y: x**2, my_list)
```

Use instead:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = map(lambda x: x**2, my_list)
```

## Options

- [`lint.dummy-variable-rgx`](../../settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx)
