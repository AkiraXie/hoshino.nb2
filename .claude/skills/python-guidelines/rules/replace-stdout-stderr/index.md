Derived from the **[pyupgrade](../#pyupgrade-up)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Checks for uses of `subprocess.run` that send `stdout` and `stderr` to a
pipe.

## Why is this bad?

As of Python 3.7, `subprocess.run` has a `capture_output` keyword argument
that can be set to `True` to capture `stdout` and `stderr` outputs. This is
equivalent to setting `stdout` and `stderr` to `subprocess.PIPE`, but is
more explicit and readable.

## Example

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run(["foo"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
```

Use instead:

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run(["foo"], capture_output=True)
```

## Fix safety

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because replacing `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and
`stderr=subprocess.PIPE` with `capture_output=True` may delete comments attached
to the original arguments.
