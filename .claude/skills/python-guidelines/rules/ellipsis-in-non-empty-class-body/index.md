Derived from the **[flake8-pyi](../#flake8-pyi-pyi)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## What it does

Removes ellipses (`...`) in otherwise non-empty class bodies.

## Why is this bad?

An ellipsis in a class body is only necessary if the class body is
otherwise empty. If the class body is non-empty, then the ellipsis
is redundant.

## Example

```python
class Foo:
    ...
    value: int
```

Use instead:

```python
class Foo:
    value: int
```
