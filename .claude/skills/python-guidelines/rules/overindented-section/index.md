Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## What it does

Checks for over-indented sections in docstrings.

## Why is this bad?

This rule enforces a consistent style for docstrings with multiple
sections.

Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by
a blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header
and a section body. The convention is that all sections should use
consistent indentation. In each section, the header should match the
indentation of the docstring's opening quotes, and the body should be
indented one level further.

This rule is enabled when using the `numpy` and `google` conventions, and
disabled when using the `pep257` convention.

## Example

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

        Args:
            distance: Distance traveled.
            time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises:
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```

Use instead:

```python
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises:
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```
